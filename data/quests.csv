2,"The mighty hippogryph Sharptalon has been slain, with the claw of the felled beast serving as a testament to your victory.  Senani Thunderheart at the Splintertree Post will no doubt be interested in seeing this trophy as proof of your deeds."
5,"I've been stuck hiding in this ghost town for weeks, and I haven't eaten anything but grubs and weeds!  I need some decent food, and I'm willing to trade well for it.Bring me a feast and I'll pay you handsomely.I heard Chef Grual at the Scarlet Raven Tavern in Darkshire makes very good Dusky Crab Cakes..."
6,"Garrick Padfoot - a cutthroat who's plagued our farmers and merchants for weeks - was seen at a shack near the vineyards, which lies east of the Abbey and across the bridge.  Bring me the villain's head, and earn his bounty!But be wary, <name>.  Garrick has gathered a gang of thugs around him.  He will not be an easy man to reach."
7,"Your first task is one of cleansing, <name>.  A clan of kobolds have infested the woods to the north.  Go there and fight the kobold vermin you find.  Reduce their numbers so that we may one day drive them from Northshire."
8,"Hey, mate! Do a favor for a young man who's been fighting more than his fair share of mindless zombies and spiders?I got this here letter that needs to go to Brill... to an innkeeper named Renee something-or-other. Don't really matter none what her last name is.Anyway, it's a nice cozy little place full of victims of the plague trying to make their way in the world. And it be a great spot for you to rest too if the need arises. You should check it out... you do and I'll pay you well."
9,"Look at what has happened to this place!  These lands were once occupied by good farm folk.  But the damned thieves have driven them all off.  Not me, though!  But it seems some Harvest Watchers have taken over the fields.If you're up for the work, I'd like you to go out and kill twenty of them.  Come back when you're done for your pay.  If you finish up with the ones in my field, clear them from the neighboring fields as well."
10,"Oh, this is just terrible!  I sent out my top assistant, Junior Surveyor Scrimshank, into the desert southeast of here.  That's an area we call the Gaping Chasm.  Well, he's gone missing, and his last report had more of those weird bugs where he was.  Could it be that they've infested two major regions of the desert now?I need you to head into the Gaping Chasm and look for Scrimshank, please!  That... or at least find his surveying equipment.  I fear that may be all that is left of the poor sod."
11,"Gnolls, brutish creatures with no decent business in these lands, have been seen along the borders of Elwynn Forest.  A large pack of them, many more than we can handle alone, have infested the woods south of the guard tower yonder.  Another group has infested the areas near Stone Cairn Lake to the east.The Stormwind Army will commend whomever helps kill them.  Bring me their painted gnoll armbands as proof of your deed."
12,"The People's Militia has but one goal:  To defend the lands of Westfall and return peace to our surroundings.  Unfortunately, the price of peace is often blood.One of my scouts has brought word of a band of Defias Trappers wreaking havoc nearby.  I have reports of Defias Trapper sightings near the Jangolode Mine to the Northwest as well as at the Molsen Farm and Furlbrow's Pumpkin Farm. If you seek to join our ranks, slay 15 Defias Trappers and 15 Defias Smugglers then return to me."
13,"A band of vicious Defias Pillagers has been seen plundering the Gold Coast Quarry, Moonbrook and the Alexston Farmstead.  The People's Militia will not stand for such behavior.  Dispatch immediately, <name>, and make the Light's presence known in Westfall.The Gold Coast Quarry is near the shore, to the West of the tower.  As the next step of your training, I want you to kill 15 of those foul Defias Pillagers and 15 Defias Looters."
14,"Some Defias have eluded us.  My most trusted scout reports that these Defias have been looting and pillaging the countryside, all the way into Southern Westfall.  We believe they are hiding out in the Dagger Hills, plotting their next move.   Slay the wretches in the name of The People's Militia."
15,"<name>, my scouts tell me that the kobold infestation is larger than we had thought.  A group of kobold workers has camped near the Echo Ridge Mine to the north.Go to the mine and remove them.  We know there are at least 10.  Kill them, see if there are more, then report back to me."
17,"I've heard about a newly discovered plant called the magenta fungus caps.  They grow in clusters at the Uldaman dig site and can be found in the early tunnels and deep within the less-explored areas.  I want to study their potential use in alchemy, and that's where you come in.Find the magenta cap clusters and bring me a dozen caps.  Be warned, the clusters may spew out poison spores if jostled.Do this for me, and I'll whip up a batch of one of my famous restorative elixirs for you!"
18,"Recently, a new group of thieves has been hanging around Northshire.  They call themselves the Defias Brotherhood, and have been seen across the river to the east.I don't know what they're up to, but I'm sure it's not good!  Bring me the bandanas they wear, and I'll reward you with a weapon."
19,Blackrock Outrunners and Renegades are running ambushes between here and Stonewatch Keep.  The leader of the Outrunners is an orc named Tharil'zun--we want this orc.  Bring me the head of Tharil'zun!
20,"The Blackrock orcs have travelled from the Burning Steppes and claimed Stonewatch Keep to the north.  From there they maraud the areas north of Lakeshire and keep its citizens in town, penned like cattle.Help rid Lakeshire of this menace.  Kill these Blackrock orcs and bring me ten of their Battleworn Axes as proof.And although Blackrocks threaten us from the north, we've received reports of more in the southeastern pocket of Redridge.  If you find any there, then they too should be hunted."
21,"Your previous investigations are proof that the Echo Ridge Mine needs purging.  Return to the mine and help clear it of kobolds.Waste no time, <name>.  The longer the kobolds are left unmolested in the mine, the deeper a foothold they gain in Northshire."
22,The onions are peeled.  The garlic is minced.  The rosemary is crushed.  The crust has been baked.  The dill weed is chopped.  The gravy is simmering.  Now all I need for my famous meat pie are 8 Goretusk Livers!
23,The paw of the mighty bear Ursangous is your trophy for this part of the Ashenvale Hunt.  On the paw is a small quarter-crescent emblem; the significance of the emblem remains a mystery.The paw should be brought to Senani Thunderheart in Splintertree Post to prove that you have bested the mighty creature and completed this portion of the hunt.
24,The once swift Shadumbra now lies still as you claim victory over it.  The head of the slain nightsaber is a fitting trophy for this fight of the Ashenvale Hunt.  Senani Thunderheart at Splintertree Post will want to see such a trophy to award you credit for this part of the Ashenvale Hunt.
25,"If you want to be useful, then why don't you do something about the situation near Talondeep Path?The transports between Ashenvale and Stonetalon are at a standstill because of the lake coming alive and attacking anything that gets close... which means anyone on the path.  What'd be even more useful than just putting the hammer down on the water elementals there is someone scouting the gazebo on Mystral Lake - the one that has a solid view of the Alliance outpost there.You up for being useful?"
26,"<name>, I have been following your progress with much delight.  You are most assuredly developing yourself into a valued protector of nature.The time has come for you to learn more about one of the various animal aspects that Cenarius has blessed us with the ability to change into - one that affords you command and mastery of the water.  For this, you must travel to the village of Nighthaven in Moonglade and speak with Dendrite Starblaze of the Cenarion Circle there.  He will guide you further."

28,"For your first trial, search the depths of Lake Elune'ara to locate a Shrine Bauble.  It decays rapidly, so proceed with it to the Shrine of Remulos post haste.  Use the bauble at the shrine, and then speak with Tajarri there; she is one of Moonglade's most trusted wardens.You only have a set amount of time to complete the task, and you may be competing against other druids searching for baubles themselves.  Mental and physical dexterity will be critical to your success.Good luck, <name>."

Mental and physical dexterity will be critical to your success.Good luck, <name>."
30,"For the second trial, you'll need the two halves that make the Pendant of the Sea Lion.  One half draws power from the agility of the sea lion aspect, gliding through water; the other draws power from the incredible endurance of the sea lion aspect.  Druids draw on both these traits equally to embody the aspect of their aquatic form.Speak with the locals of Moonglade to learn where the parts may lie, and bring both here to join them together.  Once formed, take the pendant to Dendrite Starblaze."
31,"You have completed the necessary lessons all young druids are taught before they can adopt an aquatic aspect.  Go now back to your trainer, Turak Runetotem, in Thunder Bluff.  Show him your pendant and prove to him you are ready to learn what he has to teach you.  He will complete your training, allowing you to become one with the water.Goodbye, young druid.  We shall speak again."
32,"Here's your report.  I urge you to take it to someone who might have working knowledge in this kind of thing.I know this troll scholar named Zilzibin Drumlore.  He's spent a lot of time studying life forms that are unique to the ecology of Azeroth; he's a historian to boot!  If you want someone to help figure out what exactly this threat is and how to stop it, give this report to him.  We're going to need all the help we can get.Zil lives in a house on the second tier of the Drag in Orgrimmar."
33,I hate those nasty timber wolves!  But I sure like eating wolf steaks...  Bring me tough wolf meat and I will exchange it for something you'll find useful.Tough wolf meat is gathered from hunting the timber wolves and young wolves wandering the Northshire countryside.
34,"Once again my garden was trampled and pillaged.  And I know the brute who is doing it.  It's that forsaken boar, the one Marshal Marris has taken to calling Bellygrub.I won't be able to re-plant the daffodils until next season now.  Ruined!  All ruined by that one menacing boar.  Put an end to that pest!  Show me his tusk and I'd be happy to reward you.  He seems to spend his time foraging in the field southwest of Lakeshire but occasionally he roams over here and into my garden."
35,"If you are concerned that the rumors of murlocs are true, then do this -- travel to the eastern Elwynn bridge and speak with Guard Thomas.  He has been stationed at the bridge for the past week and will know the state of the area.Bring me his report."
36,"I never thought the day would come when I'd leave the farm.  But the fields are overrun with thieves and it's far too dangerous for us here now.  As soon as Farmer Furlbrow gets the wagon fixed, we'll be on our way.Maybe you could do me a favor?  Let me scribble down my recipe for Westfall stew.  Please take it to Salma Saldean over on the farm yonder.  The Saldean's farm is just beyond the fork in the road."
37,"A few days ago we sent two Guards, Rolf and Malakai, to investigate along the river, and they have not yet returned.  To complete my report, I must know what happened to those men.Travel north along the river and find the guards... or their remains."
38,Help me make some Westfall Stew!  Come back with the following ingredients:3 Stringy Vulture Meat3 Goretusk Snouts3 Murloc Eyes3 Okra
39,"Tell Marshal Dughan of Malakai and Rolf's deaths, and report to him that the Murlocs in eastern Elwynn cannot be contained by our current troop presence.I know we don't have many troops to spare, but hopefully Dughan can find someone."
40,"<name>, there's a new threat in Elwynn Forest!  Murlocs are swimming up the streams of eastern Elwynn, scaring away fish and attacking gentle folk!I warned Marshal Dughan, but he's more worried about the gnolls and the bandits.  He's not convinced that the murlocs are a danger.Please, <name>, speak to Dughan and persuade him to send more troops to the east!"
45,"Upon further searching the area, you find webbed footprints leading east along the shore of Stone Cairn Lake.  In the distance to the east, you can just barely see a Murloc village.Perhaps Rolf's fate ended there..."
46,"The Stormwind Army has placed a bounty on murloc lurkers and foragers in Elwynn.  Slaughter them and bring me their torn murloc fins, and the Stormwind Army will reward you well.The murlocs have built a village at Stone Cairn Lake north of here, and another to the south where the stream forks."
47,"The Kobolds in these parts sometimes carry Gold Dust on them.  I could really use the stuff - bring me a load of it and I'll give you the best price in town...best price in town!You can find kobolds in the Fargodeep Mine to the south, and around the Jasperlode Mine to the northeast."
48,In the land to the south where vines twist and creepLies a hidden well where the water runs deepPure as the Light's sacred DaughterBring to me now some Holy Spring Water.
49,"Amber is the hue of my life's longest loveLike the last embers of dusk in the sky aboveRetrieve for me so that my love shall be bornOne sack of each: barley, rye and corn."
50,I'll mix and mix till we have a mashFor this will be our own private stashA still must be fashioned of metal strongBring me some Truesilver so I can finish this song.
51,"Not yet filtered but freshly distilledLike unseeded land waiting there tilled.Next I will fashion our pile of charcoalDeliver a sycamore branch, that is your next goal."
52,"Hail, <name>.  Wild animals are growing more and more aggressive the farther we get from Goldshire, and the Eastvale Logging Camp suffers nearly constant attacks from wolves and bears!We could use your help out here."
53,Mellifluous liquid clear as a baby's tearsTurns a lovely deep amber over the yearsBut before we proceed to get lit to the hiltA barrel of charred oak must be built.
54,"<name>, you are a <class> with proven interest in the security of Northshire.  You are now tasked with the protection of the surrounding Elwynn Forest.If you accept this duty, then I have prepared papers that must be delivered to Marshal Dughan in Goldshire.  Goldshire lies along the southern road, past the border gates."
55,"Morbent Fel hides in his lair, the house perched atop the hill to the east overlooking the Raven Hill cemetery.  His time in this land is drawing to an end...Use Morbent's Bane against him.  It will render his protective magics powerless.Slay him.  Slay him, and save us from his wickedness.  Be the instrument of my revenge, and a hero of Duskwood!"
56,"As Commander of The Night Watch it is my sworn duty to protect the citizens of Darkshire.  Stormwind has retracted their commissioned guards from their posts here, leaving us to our own devices.If you feel worthy of the task, we need your help! Assist The Night Watch by venturing forth into Tranquil Gardens, just south of Darkshire, and slaying 8 Skeletal Warriors and 6 Skeletal Mages.  The undead threat must be thwarted!"
57,"<name>, I'm getting reports of an undead infestation in the forest!  If you're up to the job, journey to the Raven Hill graveyard and slay 15 of those vile Skeletal Fiends and 15 Skeletal Horrors.  There are also reports of skeletons just south of Darkshire, in and around Tranquil Gardens Cemetery.  The undead must be driven from Duskwood!"
58,"The situation in Raven Hill is still grim.  The safety of Darkshire is in your hands, <name>.  I don't have enough Watchers to keep the town safe.  We need you to dispatch for Raven Hill yet again and rid the eastern mausoleum of 20 Plague Spreaders!"
59,"For your shrewdness and valor, I have a marker here that is good for one piece of armor.  I want you to take it to Sara Timberlain at the Eastvale Logging Camp.  Give her the marker, and she will fashion the armor for you.  And after you receive it, <name>, use it in the defense of Elwynn.The Eastvale Logging Camp is beyond Guard Thomas' post to the east."
60,"Hello, <good sir/my lady>!  Do you have a moment?My brother and I run an apothecary in Stormwind, and I'm here to gather large candles for their wax.  Can you help me?You can get large candles from kobolds, and I hear rumors that kobolds are infesting the Elwynn mines ... the Fargodeep mine to the south and Jasperlode Mine to the east.  I suggest looking for candles in one of those places."
61,"My brother Morgan is waiting in Stormwind for my shipment of candles.  I don't have enough time to make the trip myself, but if you'd like to take him the shipment, he'll pay you well.I've packed up the candles, and you can find Morgan in our shop, Pestle's Apothecary, in the Stormwind Trade District."
62,"The mine in Northshire isn't the only one with problems!  I have reports that the Fargodeep Mine in Elwynn has also become a haven for Kobolds.Explore the mine and confirm these reports, then return to me.  The mine is almost due south of Goldshire, between the Stonefield and Maclure homesteads."
63,"Along the coast of Silverpine, west of the Sepulcher, you will find a shrine that has become tainted by the plague. The spirits there no longer speak to our people and it will be up to you to defeat the manifestation and cleanse the pool.Take the elemental's bracers, along with the remaining drops of Brine's potion, and place them on the brazier. The ritual should be enough to summon a pure spirit for you to communicate with.Bring me proof the task is done, and I will reward you with your totem."
64,"It was horrible!  Verna woke me when she heard a ruckus in the fields.  The fields were full of hooligans.  We left in a rush and I forgot to pack my pocket watch.  Verna's pa gave me that watch on our wedding day and I feel just sick knowing those thieves have it.  I left the pocket watch in the wardrobe at the farmhouse.  Look for the field of pumpkins to the West -- you can't miss it.  If you bring it back to me, I'd sure be grateful!"
65,"The band of wretches responsible for driving the good people of Westfall from the land call themselves The Defias Brotherhood.  I need you to infiltrate this clan of thugs.  We need to know who heads up the cartel and where they are hiding out.  In Lakeshire, in the inn, there is a rogue by the name of Wiley who owes me a favor.Travel to Lakeshire in the Redridge Mountains, east of Elwynn, and find out what you can."
66,"Last night a horrible disturbance rippled through my veins.  I sensed that my granddaughter, Alyssa, was in great danger.  I consulted the cards and Death stared up at me from the table.After taking a long journey through a dark trance I was able to uncover a clue to this terrifying mystery.  A name came to me, the name of Stalvan.Seek out the Clerk in the Town Hall and see if you can find out more about this character.  I fear for us all."
67,"Stalvan, eh?  Let me check the town registry.Stalvan. . .Stalvan. . .let's see.  Ah, here we go!  I have a record of a Mr. Stalvan Mistmantle.  The last recorded address is the Moonbrook Schoolhouse.  My, talk about outdated!Do me a favor will you, friend?  If you happen to go out to Moonbrook, let me know if you get any update on this fellow.  I like to keep the records clean."
68,You find a Dusty Unsent Letter in the old footlocker.
69,"Oh my!  Must have missed this the first time.  In the registry, right beneath the first address for Stalvan there's another one listed, only partially scratched out.  Looks like he was headed to The Lion's Pride Inn over in Goldshire.  Might want to check there, <name>."
70,"The name Stalvan rings a bell.  I remember now.Many years back, on a stormy night, a messenger came in, seeking refuge for the night.  Near the stroke of midnight, the man ran down the stairs screaming, his face pale with fear.  Still wearing his bedclothes, he disappeared into the downpour.In his haste he forgot his letters in the chest upstairs.  He never returned for them. One remains from that Stalvan fellow, intended for the Canal District in Stormwind.  Help yourself to it."
71,"Now that you have both medallions, deliver them to Guard Thomas at the bridge so that he might know the fate of his murdered guards."
72,My father was the caretaker of the estate long before I was.  He had to mop the blood up after the massacre.  But that's neither here nor there.The last funds of the Flintridge trust have dried up.  Now the last of the family possessions are headed for auction.  Blame the tax vultures.  I guess if you're really itching to learn more you're free to look through this junk.  Who knows what you might find.
74,"Inside the crate you find various objects: musty heirlooms, a family portrait, a few hunting trophies and some old books.  Near the bottom, underneath a ceramic vase, you uncover A Torn Journal Page."
75,"There was a bundle of parchments in the chest upstairs when I moved into this place.  I looked at them once when I first arrived but I gave up once the fog hazed over my peepers.Do an old, nearly-blind man a favor and check the chest upstairs for anything that might help you in your quest to discover more about this Stalvan character.  I'm pretty sure there's a faded journal page that might be of interest to you.  Bring it to me and I'll help in anyway I can."
76,"Thanks to you we know the Fargodeep Mine is infested with kobolds.  Now we need a scout to investigate the more distant Jasperlode Mine.Explore Jasperlode and confirm any kobold presence.  To reach the mine, travel east along the road until you reach the Tower of Azora.  From the tower, head north and you'll find the mine in the foothills."
77,"I possess original packaging materials for the ripple Dran Droffers seeks.  I will assist you in packaging the ripple for Malton's abrasive father... for a fee of two additional bottles of said ripple.  They are located in crates found in the abandoned Horde base near Skulk Rock.It will be an arduous task, to wit; foul slimes and oozes will be found sticking to the ruins; rumor has it they are led by some sort of master ooze.  Regardless, procure the ripple and return to me here for packaging."
78,"I know of someone who might be able to assist you.  Back when I was leading the Stormwind Guard, we used to get drinks at the Scarlet Raven Tavern in Darkshire.  The Innkeeper there, Smitts, was quite an expert on the local lore.  Show him this page and see what he has to say about it."
79,I followed the legend of that Stalvan character for years.  When those visiting nobles were slaughtered a few years back I went with Haggard to investigate.  I found these muddy pages but we were never able to link the handwriting to that crazy man in the woods.  Your trail of evidence proves his guilt.  Take this to Commander Ebonlocke immediately and fill her in on what you've discovered!
80,"I have had my eye on that creep, Stalvan, for quite sometime.  But if this page was written by the same hand it proves his guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt.In all his days keeping the Town Registry, Clerk Daltry has become an expert at identifying handwriting.  Show him this page and see if the writing matches that of the registry signature."
81,"I have taken the extra step of securing not only Dran's packaged ripple in the barrel, but also the extra bottles of ripple he is purloining.  While I may not hold Dran very highly, there is nothing worse than jostled ripple.  You're welcome.Now, deliver yon barrel to Dran Droffers in his salvage emporium in Orgrimmar.  Pray tell, please extend my warmest greetings to Malton; let him know that should he ever thirst for fine drink and finer drinking companions, we would be honored with his visit."
82,"All right now, these reports about the bugs... what we know is that they are draining the water pools that used to be where the Noxious Lair is. What we DON'T know is, well, everything else.Let's figure out who our enemy is first! I want you to head into the Noxious Lair and get some parts off of those critters. Get five from the Centipaar there and bring them to Alchemist Pestlezugg for him to dink with. With him on the case, we'll figure out what they are!"
83,"The Defias gang in Northshire wears burlap masks, but the Defias in Elwynn wear linen which I can use to make fine linen goods.Bring me red linen bandanas and I'll use them to fashion something for you.Defias gang members have camps pocketed throughout Elwynn."
84,"Here you go.  And when you give this pie to that Billy, you tell him I hope he chokes on it!"
85,"I lost my necklace, and think that guttersnipe Billy Maclure took it!  He's usually scuttling like a rat around the Maclure vineyards east of here.Get my necklace back for me, and you'll warm an old widow's heart."
86,"Maybe if I got a pie, I could tell you who has that necklace.  And you know, I think that old Bernice lady at that other farm makes great Pork Belly Pies...Maybe if you gave her some chunks of boar meat from the boars that hang around our farms, and told her what it was for, she'd bake up a pie for you."
87,"I was playing near the Fargodeep Mine, and I think I dropped, er...I mean I saw, the old lady's necklace.  Don't ask me how it got there...it wasn't me!Well anyway, I saw this big, gold-toothed kobold pick up the necklace and run into the mine.  Go find that kobold and you'll find the necklace, I swear!"
88,"The Brackwells have a prize-winning pig, Princess.  The sow is HUGE, and she got that way from sneaking over here and eating my veggies!So before she comes to our fields...Princess must die!  Bring me her collar as proof of the deed and I'll give you something for your time!Princess is usually over at the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch, to the east and beyond the Maclure farm.  Get her before she gets hungry and comes back here!"
89,"During the last orc invasion we were forced to smelt our iron down to make bullets, swords and armor.  We sent word to Stormwind for a new shipment of materials but a band of Redridge gnolls hijacked the caravan and ran off into the hills behind Lakeshire.Now we're coming up short on supplies to get this bridge rebuilt.  If you can bring me 5 iron pikes and 5 iron rivets, <name>, I'll make sure you're rewarded.Now let's get to work!"
90,"Seasoned Wolf Kabobs are a house favorite!  Sure, I can make you some.  But first I'll need the supplies.  Bring me 10 Lean Wolf Flanks as well as some Stormwind Seasoning Herbs.  There are so many wolves here in the forest, I am sure finding the Flanks will be no problem.  For the herbs, seek out Felicia Gump in her canal district flower shop in Stormwind."
91,"An enemy of Stormwind has taken up residence in the eastern foothills of Redridge. This wicked villain uses the Arcane to spread terror and misery upon our town and our people. Under the name, Morganth, he conducts his evil business.Morganth now controls the Shadowhide Gnoll Clan to perform his biddings. As stated by the Law of Lakeshire, aiding a criminal of the Kingdom is punishable by death.These vile gnolls must be killed!Turn in 10 Shadowhide Pendants to me, and you shall be rewarded."
92,"Nothing would please me more than to make you some Redridge Goulash. But there's a slight problem. During the recent orc uprising I fed the entire brigade of Stormwind troops. My cupboard is now bare. But if you can provide me with the ingredients, I'd be happy to oblige.Just bring me five pieces of Tough Condor Meat, five Great Goretusk Snouts and five helpings of Crisp Spider Meat."
93,"I'll let you in on a little secret - Dusky ""Crab"" Cakes are really made from spider legs!  I know it's a bit disgusting, but the cakes have a nice, tangy flavor and make great snacks!  Bring me Gooey Spider Legs and I'll whip you up a few of them.I hear Venom Web Spiders are a good source - they nest to the north, between the foothills and the river."
94,"My rival, Morganth, is a vicious mage of great power who lives in the Tower of Ilgalar in Redridge.  I have developed a means of spying on him, the Eye of Azora, and can now view him from afar.But to study his thoughts ... I require further aid.If you are willing, then take my Glyph of Azora to the Tower of Ilgalar.  Place it upon the Lion Statue near the Tower.When this is done, the power of Azora will grant visions of Morganth's future plans."
95,"I used to work one of the farms to the southeast...until Dark Riders from Deadwind Pass descended upon my farm and slaughtered my family when I was away!When I returned I saw a shadowy figure skulking near my barn, burying something.  He fled before I could catch him, and I couldn't linger for I was hot on the heels of the Dark Riders.  So I never discovered what was hidden.If you can find what that shadowy figure buried, I would be grateful.  The hiding spot is behind the old stump near my barn."
96,Take shard. Take shard and give life.Give life and understand. Understand water is life... corruption stops life.You protect and give life with water's power.
97,"Let Commander Ebonlocke know immediately that the handwriting matched, <name>!  Her suspicions were correct!"
98,"Stalvan Mistmantle led a life of depravity.  Innocent victims died by his hand.  Undoubtedly he is guilty of countless crimes.  Now the lunatic threatens Darkshire.  The Light only knows what sordid acts he is plotting.  Travel to his cottage just north of town, <class>, and execute Stalvan, once and for all.When the deed is done, travel to Madame Eva's and show her his family ring.  After all, it was her premonition that led to this gruesome discovery.  But Darkshire is safer because of her."
99,"As my understanding of Arugal's magic grows so does my disdain for the hapless fool.  I am close to completing my research on his so called remedy.My knowledge will be complete when I learn what enchantment is causing the strange behavior going on in Pyrewood Village.  By day, the peasants appear to be Human.  But when the sun goes down the townsfolk turn into Moonrage Worgen.I need to draw energy from the enchanted shackles Arugal cast on them.  Bring to me six enchanted Pyrewood Shackles, <name>."
100,Light explodes as you finish the incantation. The sounds of the water drops hitting the flame have died down and your senses are overcome as the corrupt spirits around you are destroyed.
101,"As the mystical taint creeps through the forest, the need for self-protection is undeniable, <name>.  The winds whisper to me and they speak of a great danger which waits patiently for you in the near future.If you wish to protect yourself, noble <class>, bring to me 10 ghoul fangs, 10 skeleton fingers and 5 vials of spider venom.  For you I shall enchant a Totem of Infliction which will harm those who attempt violent acts against you."
102,"Stormwind has abandoned us.  A foul wind of depravity rustles through the plains of Westfall.  This was my homeland and I will not turn my back on the citizens who choose to remain here.  We, the former farmers, shall make our stand.Your task, should you choose to accept, is to patrol the grasslands of Westfall.  Track down and slay the vile Gnolls that seem to be working in conjunction with the Deadmines thieves. Bring me eight Gnoll Paws and I will reward your bravery."
103,"The night the Lighthouse Keeper's family died was horrible.  I watched, helpless, as Old Murk-Eye led the attack.  But what's done is done and now my concern is for the lives of the sailors on The Great Sea whose ships come close to the perilous rocks of the coastline.  With no one to keep watch on the flame the responsibility has fallen upon me.Help me keep the torch lit by bringing me 5 flasks of oil from the Harvest Monsters."
104,"When my life was ended upon the rocks, I had no clue what the afterlife held for me.  The Lighthouse was black that night because Old Murk-Eye had scared the keeper's family off.  They returned and re-lit the flame but Old Murk-Eye coerced the weaker minded murlocs to raid the Lighthouse with him once again.  The second time the family was not so lucky and before my eyes they perished helplessly.Slay Old Murk-Eye if you see him along the shore and bring me one of his scales and I shall reward you."
105,"Alas, the time to attack Andorhal and drive out the lich that controls it is upon us!Inside the ruins of the city is where the lich - Araj the Summoner - holds dominion.  He is guarded by numerous Scourge surrounding the remains of city's center, and his personal retinue of guardians attached to him directly is formidable.  You will need numerous allies to even stand a chance of facing him successfully.Destroy Araj, <name>, and bring me a shard from his phylactery as proof!"
106,"Oh, I'm cursed!  My heart belongs to Tommy Joe Stonefield, but our families are bitter enemies.  So I can't see him, even though my eyes ache to gaze upon that handsome face!Please, take this letter and give it to Tommy Joe.  He's usually at the river to the west of the Stonefield Farm, which is due west of here."
107,"I bet William Pestle has a potion to unite our two young lovers!Here, take this note to William.  He's staying at the Lion's Pride Inn in Goldshire."
109,"Looks to me you've seen quite a bit of combat in your time, <class>.  If you haven't already, you should report to Gryan Stoutmantle.  He heads up the People's Militia, aimed at protecting the farmlands of Westfall.  I bet he could use your help.  You can usually find him in the stone tower on Sentinel Hill, just off the road in the middle of Westfall."
110,"I'm going to spend some time taking a look at Scrimshank's surveying gear... as well as putting his personal effects in order.  I get the sneaking feeling behind my ears that this isn't the last loss we'll be facing against these bugs.I'd like for you to check in with Alchemist Pestlezugg to see if he has had a chance to process the insect parts we sent him.  If they're ready, bring them to me."
111,"Please, <name>, talk with my Gramma.  If anyone can find a way to bring me together with Maybell, she can.She's inside our house east of here."
112,"I can make an invisibility liquor for Maybell, so she can slip away from the Maclure Vineyards and go to Tommy Joe.  But to make the Liquor, I need some crystal kelp.Although the kelp usually grows in the ocean... sometimes murlocs collect it.  See if the murlocs near Crystal Lake have any.  Crystal Lake is just east of Goldshire."
113,"Senior Surveyor Fizzledowser needs to see this report immediately.  Actually... everyone who can read needs to see this report.  We are facing a grave and serious threat to not only Tanaris and Gadgetzan, but if left unchecked, the entirety of southern Kalimdor.  Heck, even quite possible the whole of Azeroth; this thing has given no indication it will subside.Have Fizzledowser make a duplicate of the report for you to distribute freely to your allegiance. Everyone must know about this threat!"
114,Take this invisibility liquor to young Maybell.  It should last long enough for her to visit Tommy Joe.
115,"The Blackrock orcs enlisted shadowcasters to aid their attacks in Redridge, and they have brought with them devices of dark power--midnight orbs.  These orbs have struck telling blows against Redridge's defenders, and it's imperative we remove the demon-tainted items from the conflict.Find and deliver to me midnight orbs from slain Blackrock shadowcasters.  I will then have them disposed of, for this world would be a better place without them!"
116,"I find myself in quite a pinch here, <name>.  The bottles are close to running dry.  The latest booze shipment is long overdue.  The orc invasion has been hell.Perhaps you can go to work for me?I need you to pick up a keg of Thunderbrew Lager from Grimbooze Thunderbrew in the Westfall hills, a cask of Merlot from Stormwind, a bottle of Moonshine from Darkshire and a skin of Sweet Rum from Goldshire.  Bring those back to me and I will see to it you are rewarded."
117,"Hurry, my friend, move with hasteIn order for our rich lager to tasteMore like beer and less like stew,Hops are needed to make the brew."
118,"I've been using so much iron keeping the Stormwind Guards outfitted, I don't have enough to supply the stable's horses with shoes!Take this note to Blacksmith Argus in Goldshire.  It explains to him my problem and requests a shipment of horseshoes."
119,"Ok, I'll give him his 50 horseshoes...Here they are, all boxed up and ready to go!  Tell Verner it was a pleasure doing business, and be sure he reads the note attached to this crate!"
120,"These are trying times, <class>.  The township is under constant siege.  Without reinforcements, we will certainly face defeat.  The message I now entrust to you is of utmost importance.  Get this report to General Marcus Jonathan of Stormwind immediately.  Once your delivery is made, return to me at once with any news, be it good or bad.Now make haste!"
121,"While I wait for a response from the King I want you to carry this letter to Magistrate Solomon.Dismissed, <class>!"
122,"I need some underbelly scales from black dragon whelps to pay for the shoes Argus sent me from Goldshire.  If you can get 6 of them for me, then I can pay Argus with some... and have enough left to fashion something for you.Black dragon whelps are often flying around south of Lakeshire, but they like to wander.  You might have to just keep an eye out and hunt them when you see them."
123,"This note is a schedule with a list of days and times when a person -- described only as ""The Collector"" -- will receive a shipment of gold from the mines in Elwynn Forest.From the schedule, it looks as if the Collector resides near the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch in eastern Elwynn.This sounds important.  You should report it to Marshal Dughan in Goldshire."
124,"As if the attacking orcs weren't enough!  Now I have gnoll brutes and mystics prowling along the ridge north of my stable, taking my horses when they stray...If you can get rid of those gnolls, my horses and I would be very grateful."
125,"I could really use a hand here, <name>.  With the town under siege, it's been hard to get supplies.  My tools were being delivered from Goldshire by wagon but the bridge was blown out.  We put the tools in a boat but the orcs hit it with a catapult.  Just my luck, my toolbox sank right to the bottom of the lake.Retrieve my toolbox, <name>, and I'll make it worth your while."
126,"<name>, the gnolls are still out there.  I can hear their baying as they hunt in the hills above Lakeshire.  And one cry is louder than the rest - Yowler,  their leader.Kill Yowler and send his pack scattering!  Bring me his paw as proof.And be careful, this gnoll is their leader for a reason.  He is no Mongrel..."
127,"Lake Everstill is famous for its spotted sunfish.  There's always demand for them...and I'm running low!Bring me a batch of 10 and I'll barter well for them.  If you can't fish yourself, then...maybe you can get them off the murlocs!"
128,"The Blackrock Clan must be destroyed. The Enemy has invaded our lands. These mountains fall under the sovereign right of the King of Stormwind. Our sources tell us that the leaders of each unit within the Clan are known as Champions. You'll find them in their encampment to the north, just west of the road to the Burning Steppes.Magistrate Solomon wants these foul brutes dead. Slay 15 Blackrock Champions and return to me."
129,"Can you do me a favor?  I've prepared a lunch for Guard Parker, but he's out on patrol...he's a big, strong Stormwind guard who can defend himself, but it's much too dangerous out there for a townsperson like me.So if you deliver his lunch for me, then come back here and I'll give you a free lunch!  Parker patrols the stretch of road leading to Duskwood."
130,"Before you go back to Darcy, can you bring her some flowers for me?  You can get them at the herbalist shop back in Lakeshire, at the west end of town.But when you get the flowers...don't tell the herbalist, Martie, whom they're from, or whom they're for..."
131,Here is your bouquet.  I chose Daffodils for you.  They're my favorite!
132,"What I am about to tell you could cost me my life.  The Defias gang is up to something big.  Last I heard they were working in conjunction with various gnolls, kobolds and even goblins.Take this note to Stoutmantle.  It explains as much as I know on the subject."
133,"I live so far from the protection of town, it's a wonder the ghouls and the walking dead haven't eaten me!  In fact, just yesterday a pack of Bone Chewers was pounding on the walls of my house!I want to make an effigy - a kind of ""scarecrow"" for Ghouls.  To do that I need some Ghoul Ribs.  You can get them from Flesh Eaters, Bone Chewers, Brain Eaters, Rotted Ones and Plague Spreaders.Get the ribs for me, and I will repay you with some coin."
134,"A few weeks ago I was picking herbs far from my house, and a band of ogres attacked me!  I ran, and I was forced to leave behind a crate of precious tools and herbs.After they chased me off, the ogres swaggered back to the ogre mound in southern Duskwood.  I'm sure my crate is somewhere near the mound.Please, <name>, retrieve this crate for me for I miss it sorely."
135,"I wonder what Wiley meant when he mentioned the Stonemasons.  Perhaps that was a slip of tongue.  Could the Defias gang be related to the Stonemasons?  Only one man would know for sure:  Mathias Shaw, head of SI:7. Show him Wiley's Note and see if he has anything to add to this growing mystery. If you have trouble finding Shaw, check the Barracks in Old Town."
136,"If ye be readin' this, it means that Ol' Captain Sanders is in a watery grave.  So my treasure is yours now, ye jest need to follow the clues.First ye need to find me footlocker.  It's probably half-buried in sand by now, along the Western Coast of Westfall near the shipwreck.  There be lots of shipwrecks but only one rusty anchor on the coast.  Find that anchor and you'll find me locker!  Look in there for the next clue."
138,"The clue to the treasure reads: Good work, matey!  Now ye need to head due east.  East up the bluffs, east to the road.  Look for the ol' chimney ruins near the side of the road.  There you'll find an old barrel with your next clue."
139,"Searching through the barrel you discover another piece of parchment.  This one reads:  Now from this here barrel, face ye North.  Straight as the crow flies, keep ye walkin' till you see the empty jug next to the lone windmill on the sea bluffs.  If ye poke around that jug, ye just might find what you're lookin' for."
140,"Sure enough, deep within the Old Jug there is another clue to Sander's treasure.  The ink has run in some places and the paper smells like whiskey but you can make out some of the text:  Now that ye found me ol' whiskey jug, you're almost to the treasure!  Just face West from the bottle and walk down to the shore.  Once ye get to the water, keep going!  Swim straight west till you find the island with me treasure chest!"
141,"The Stonemasons' Guild was run by a man named Edwin VanCleef.  VanCleef was responsible for rebuilding Stormwind after the orcs razed it in the First War.  Apparently, VanCleef and his men were unhappy with their treatment by the King after the reconstruction was complete.  That just might explain a thing or two.I have written a more detailed account for your Master in Westfall.  Take this to him at once!"
142,"We need to discover the location of the Defias hideout.  <name>, my scout reports that a Defias Messenger has been seen on the roads between Moonbrook, the Gold Coast Quarry and the Jangolode Mine.  I want you to capture him.  If he resists, kill him and bring me whatever he is carrying."
143,"Something odd is afoot with the Stormwind Army.  They should have been here in force by now.  Time is a luxury we don't have, however.  I will not stand by and watch the people of Lakeshire give their lives without trying to enlist more help.  I've heard word of a people's militia forming in Westfall.Take this plea to their leader, Gryan Stoutmantle.  Perhaps Stoutmantle's men can lend some support here until the King sends reserves."
144,"Magistrate Solomon's note pains me to read.  But it is obvious he knows not the war which is waged in Westfall or else he would know better than to expect aid from the Militia.  If Stormwind had not deserted us as well, we would not have the need for the Militia.Take this response to your master in Redridge, <class>.  And let him know that my heart is heavy with the loss of good men."
145,"I require your assistance once again.  I have written to Lord Ebonlocke, requesting that he sends his trained guards, the Night Watch, to help with Lakeshire's defense.  It is imperative this message makes it to him swiftly.  You must exercise extreme caution.  Ebonlocke is the mayor of Darkshire, in the heart of Duskwood.  Do not stray from the roads."
146,"If I did not know Magistrate Solomon personally, I would say the man has gone mad.  Send the Night Watch to Lakeshire because Stormwind refuses aid?  The Night Watch was formed because Stormwind left us when this foul magic seeped into the land.  If I sent my Night Watch, this town would be overrun by evil before the guards even reached the forest's edge.Take this letter of response to your Master in Lakeshire."
147,"If the ""Collector"" is taking gold from our mines then he's stealing from the kingdom!  Bring the Collector to justice, and bring me the ring mentioned in the pickup schedule you gave me.  It may tell us whom the Collector is working for...That Pickup Schedule says the Collector is hiding out at the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch.  You should search for him there."
148,"Oh, what is a poor old man to do?  I need some supplies from Darkshire, but the village is so far away and I am so old and feeble...I would never make the trip.Can you go to Darkshire and bring me back some Ghost Hair Thread?  You can get it from Madame Eva at her home on the Darkshire square."
149,"There is a poor, sad spirit, Blind Mary, who haunts an old farm house in the hills south of Darkshire.Here, take this Spectral Comb and ask Blind Mary to comb her hair.  Then bring back the comb and I will glean from it the Ghost Hair I'll need for the thread.And take care, for dark things now lurk near that house..."
150,Murlocs are becoming a problem.  Larger groups of the fishmen are dropping anchor along the shores of Lake Everstill and fishing up a storm!  We need them gone before they eat all the fish in the lake!Hunt murlocs!  Bring me eight of their fins and I might have something for you...
151,"Poor Old Blanchy!  Such a tired beast after all the work we put her through. I fed her before we left the farm, but we weren't expecting the wagon to break on us. If you could bring her a few handfuls of oats from the fields, I'd be grateful.I bet you could find some around all of the farms in Westfall, if you can steer clear of those horrific machines that have taken over. There are several farms southwest of here."
152,"You probably noticed all of the shipwrecks along the coast.  The Great Sea is treacherous indeed.  The coast of Westfall needs to be kept clear, so that if sailors find their way to our beaches, they are safe.  The Murlocs are trouble though.Kill 7 Tidehunters, 7 Warriors, 7 Oracles and 7 Coastrunners and I will see to it that you are rewarded."
153,"The Defias Front is constantly shifting.  I've been following their movements for quite some time now.  On a side note, I've ascertained that many members of the gang can be tracked by the Red Leather Bandanas they wear.Bring me 15 of these Bandanas and I'll see to it you are rewarded."
154,"NO!!!!!Take it, take this comb away from me!I'm a monster, and no one will ever think me lovely again!"
155,"So Stoutmantle sends a scrawny <race> like you to protect me?  Guess you'll have to do.  Better bring some friends too.You know the deal, right?  You watch my back and I'll take you to the Defias hideout.  But you better be close by my side.  The Defias gang wants my head now.  If they see me with you, they'll try to kill me.Let me know when you and any friends you can round up are ready to go."
156,"If you bring me some rot blossoms then I can brew you up a batch of zombie juice.Rot blossoms grow in strange places.  In particular, I hear you can find them inside the skulls of Skeletal Horrors and Skeletal Fiends... not that I've gotten close enough to look!The Raven Hill Cemetery is lousy with those skeletons.  You may as well get rid of them while you're looking for rot blossoms.  The town of Darkshire would be grateful."
157,"Here is your thread, <name>.  It has a thousand uses, from binding evil spirits to sewing life into inanimate objects."
158,"I need a bottle of a certain liquor - Zombie Juice.  Tavernkeep Smitts at the Scarlet Raven Tavern in Darkshire should have some.And please hurry, <name>.  These nights get cold, and I need that drink to put fire in my veins again!"
159,Here's your Zombie Juice......and be careful with this stuff.  It's strong enough to raise the dead!
160,"Take this note to Ello Ebonlocke, the Mayor of Darkshire.He and I are old friends...and when he reads it and discovers what you did for me...I'm sure he'll be just as happy as I am!  Hahahaha!"
161,"If my suspicions are correct, this is some type of explosive powder.  This must be analyzed by an explosives expert so we know just what we're dealing with here.  Ashlan Stonesmirk was assigned to the regiment guarding Dun Modr and the Thandol Span.  I need you to make a grave and perilous journey, <name>.Travel through the Algaz Gate, follow the road through the Wetlands and seek out Stonesmirk in Dun Modr.  Heed my advice: stick to the roads and stop for nothing!"
162,"I urge you to take this report to someone who has working knowledge in this kind of thing.I know this night elf scholar named Gracina Spiritmight.  She's spent a lot of time studying life forms that are unique to the ecology of Azeroth; she's a historian to boot!  If you want someone to help figure out what exactly this threat is, and more importantly how to stop it, give her the report.  We'll need the help.Last I heard, she was residing in the Temple of the Moon, located in Darnassus."
163,"Something's amiss at Raven Hill, <name>. Calor swears that someone--or something--is haunting the buildings there. Two nights running he's noticed the shadows moving, and the third before that he says he saw light in one of the windows.If, as you say, you care about the safety of Duskwood, find out what monster haunts in Raven Hill."
164,"Do you know Sven? Now, there is a man who does the work of the Light! He and his followers keep a camp at the northwestern edge of Duskwood.Unfortunately, because they are so few, they cannot even spare a man to fetch supplies from town. Will you deliver these supplies to him?"
165,"There was an old man who used to come into town to buy supplies rather frequently, but I haven't seen him for quite some time now. He lives out in a shack overlooking Raven Hill cemetery, if I remember correctly. Perhaps you should go see if something is amiss."
166,"There is but one task left for you to complete.  Edwin VanCleef must be assassinated.  While it saddens me to condemn any man to a death sentence, it is for the greater good of the people of Westfall that VanCleef is laid to rest once and for all.  Bring me the villain's head once the deed is done."
167,"We were deep in a vast mine in Westfall, hidden beneath a barn in Moonbrook. No clue where these stinkin' thieving types came from. Anyway, the mine tunnel collapsed on us. I got out but the others... well... the others haven't been heard from.You look like you might have better luck in there. If you could look for my brother, I'd be thankful.  He always carried his Explorers' League Badge. If you can't find him, that badge would at least give me some peace of mind."
168,"Many of my friends perished that horrible day when the mine tunnel caved in.  If your adventures happen to bring you into that wing of the mine in Moonbrook, please keep an eye out for any sign which might identify them.  If you come across any of their Miners' Union Cards, bring them back to me and I'll make sure their families get some resolution from this horrible accident."
169,"Wanted! Gath'Ilzogg, Leader of the Blackrock attacks on Stonewatch Keep and raids against the township of Lakeshire.Gath'Ilzogg is extremely dangerous.  He is reportedly holed up in the recently conquered keep plotting the Blackrock clan's further crimes against humanity.  The orc infestation must be quelled at all costs.  A gracious reward will be given to whatever brave soul can deliver the head of Gath'Ilzogg to Magistrate Solomon."
170,"I hope you're here to lend us a hand, <class>. After the last trogg attack, we could use all the help we can get.I hear the buggers have been popping up all across the lands, and it seems Coldridge Valley is no exception. They've been spotted all over the hills to the southeast and near the frozen lake.And that's not all, just a few nights ago, they attacked and overran our camp to the west!We're a bit shorthanded here, < lad / lass>, and we need strong arms to help drive the troggs back."
171,"Ever since the darkness came to Duskwood, the wolves grew more feral. They were always a nuisance, but never a threat. Everything changes for the worst here, it would seem.They used to have a stranglehold in the woods, but since the worgen started appearing in Duskwood, the wolves have been pushed back to the northern and western borders.Nonetheless, the worgen didn't rid us of the problem, so it looks like it's up to us to clear the mongrels out. You'll find them to the west, along the river bank."
172,"You're willing to help us here at the orphanage?  Bless you, friend; your aid during Children's Week will be invaluable."
173,"Darkness seems drawn inexorably to Duskwood. Master Carevin's quest is the expulsion of evil and heresy. Through our efforts are the people of Darkshire kept safe.You believe yourself worthy to join us?I once thought as you. Disillusioned by the complacency of the Watch, I joined Master Carevin. If you wish to prove yourself, it will not be through words.Test your skills against the Nightbane Shadow Weaver worgen in Brightwood Grove--bright, hah!--and the Rotting Orchard."
174,"My Gnomish friend, Cog, has promised to help me build a device which will let me peer towards the stars.  A truth exists, beyond magic, that can explain the strange transformation in the forest.Bring to me a bronze tube made by a skilled engineer.  That is the first step, according to Cog's blueprint."
175,"According to Cog's blueprint, what I need now is a way to reflect light.  I remember a woman by the name of Mary who became well known around these parts for always carrying a looking glass.  Perhaps you can track Mary down and see if she might lend us a reflective surface for this project?  I believe she once resided in southern Duskwood. . ."
176,"Wanted: HoggerA huge gnoll, Hogger, is prowling the woods in southwestern Elwynn.  He has overpowered all attempts at his capture.The Stormwind Army has placed a generous bounty on the Gnoll.  To earn the reward, bounty hunters should bring proof of Hogger's demise to Marshal Dughan in Goldshire."
177,"The looking glass was one of my finest treasures until. . .the incident.  After that happened, I discarded it behind the barn.  There was an Insane Ghoul who used to roam back there.  Perhaps he picked it up.  Rumor has it the devilish beast resides in the Tranquil Gardens Cemetery."
178,"<You hear a disembodied voice...>Do not be alarmed.  I am Theocritus, High Mage of Tower Azora in Elwynn Forest.  The pendant you are holding is a method of communication between the Shadowhide Gnolls and their master, Morganth.Through months of research, I believe I too can communicate through these pendants.  If you can hear this message, then my spell was a success.Bring me this pendant and I will reward you for the service."
179,"What do we have here? You look as though you might need something to keep your hands warm, hm?I'll tell you what would help: a pair of nice, warm gloves. And, being the kind soul that I am, I'd be more than happy to provide you with a suitable pair. I've one condition, however.I need you to go get me some wolf meat. Nice arrangement, hm? You bring me some wolf meat, and I'll make sure you don't lose any digits to frostbite. Well, what do you say?"
180,"Wanted: Lieutenant FangoreKnown leader of the Shadowhide Gnoll Clan, working under the enemy of the Township and Kingdom, Morganth.  By mandate of Magistrate Solomon, this vile betrayer of Stormwind is wanted dead.  Show his paw to the Magistrate as proof of his death."
181,"Now there is just one more item needed to complete this device.  Cog's blueprint calls for a lens of some sort.  The only lens I know of that would be large enough will be very difficult to acquire.There is an ogre by the name of Zzarc'Vul who resides in the mound in southern Duskwood.  If you can, bring to me his monocle and I will use that as our lens!"
182,"My brother Senir and I were sent to different parts of Dun Morogh to investigate the threat posed by the trolls. The Senate has its hands full with the troggs, so they've no need for further annoyances.From what I've seen, the trolls aren't well situated here in Coldridge Valley--mostly the southern cave. I'd say that the army will not be necessary. A few strong arms should be more than enough.Perhaps you'd like to assist in this endeavor? I have the authority to offer compensation for your help."
183,"Nothing like a day of boar hunting, eh?Though, here in Coldridge Valley, there are so many boars it almost takes the fun out of it. No need to get them charging. They're all angry and ready without any help. In fact, recently, there've been so many boars in the area, it's become dangerous for me to do my daily hunting.Long story short, if you could help me kill some of the boars, I would appreciate it."
184,"This is the deed to an expanse of farmlands within Westfall.  It is signed by a Theodore Furlbrow and cosigned by his wife, Verna.  And on the back of the deed are hastily scrawled words:""We leaned on Furlbrow and got his deed.  Thought it might be handy if you wanted to forge one of these for your own place.The Furlbrows won't give us trouble.  Last I saw them they were on their way out of Westfall, stuck with a broken wagon.""You think the Furlbrows might want their deed back..."
185,"When I was but a young girl, my father trained me in the art of tiger hunting.You'll find the young felines much easier to track and slay.  For this reason, we'll start you out easy.  One can often find young tigers near the expedition camp.Test your tracking skills and see if you can hunt some of the beasts down."
186,"You are learning, <class>.  Let us test your skills with the mature cats now. Kill 10 Stranglethorn Tigers this time out."
187,"Now I'm going to up the stakes on you and truly test your skill.  Prove to me you can kill 10 Elder Stranglethorn Tigers.  If you can do that, you will be ready for your final challenge before I declare you a master tiger hunter in Master Nesingwary's presence.Elder Stranglethorn Tigers are not only the most difficult to find, they are also the fiercest to defeat."
188,Here is the final challenge that I will put forth.  We've been tracking an elusive tiger for weeks.  We call the beast Sin'Dall.  See if you can do what no <race> has done before: hunt down and kill Sin'Dall.  Bring me her paw as proof of your accomplishment.Tracking her down will be no easy task.
189,"Damn trolls! They've been killing off our agents in the jungle! I've already lost a good number of my best guards to skirmishes with them. The costs are piling up! How will I explain this to Baron Revilgaz?Decisive action... Think, Kebok... you weren't assigned to the post you have today for sitting around... I've got it! You... <name>, is it? You'll help me, won't you? There's money to be had!Here's the deal... you bring me the ears of fifteen Bloodscalp Trolls, and I'll compensate you well."
190,"If you want to be a part of the hunt with this crack group Hemet has assembled, you're going to need to prove yourself an able panther hunter. We'll start you out easy -- don't you worry. Let's see you kill 10 young panthers to start.Tracking them down is only half the challenge..."
191,"Now you're ready to turn it up a notch.  If you want to prove yourself worthy of socializing with the likes of these big game hunters, you'll need to prove that you can kill 10 panthers.Those big boys are tougher.  They're not as easy as the young ones you were killing earlier."
192,"Now the hard part.  A true panther hunter can show skill by dropping Shadowmaw Panthers, the deadliest in Stranglethorn.  Prove to us that you can slay 10 of these beasts.If you think they are hard to track, wait until you attempt to slay one...."
193,You've almost proven yourself to be a master hunter of panthers.  A panther by the name of Bhag'thera has been prowling the jungle.  So far he's eluded our party.  See if you can use your skills to kill the great Bhag'thera.Bring me the Fang of Bhag'thera and you'll have earned my respect!
194,"So you think your hunting skills are in tip-top shape?  I can put them to the test in a jiffy.  Head out into that jungle and kill 10 Stranglethorn Raptors.  We'll see just how much of a big game hunter you are.And no, I won't tell you where you can find them!  Locating the beasts is half the challenge."
195,Now let's step up the challenge and see if you're up to it.  Venture into the jungle and bag yourself 10 of those bloody Lashtail Raptors.  Let's see what you've got!
196,Let's see how you handle this next challenge.  There is a cagey breed of raptor out there.  We call them Jungle Stalkers.  They are far more difficult to track down and kill than the other breeds you've been trying your luck at.  Kill 10 Jungle Stalkers and I'll tip you off to the best hunting yet.
197,"Because you proved yourself to be such a go-getter in the jungle, let me tell you about a ferocious raptor that even I have failed to kill.  Ajeck here calls this wily raptor Tethis.If you want to prove yourself a true master, kill Tethis and bring me his talon.  It would be a feat that no other big game hunter has accomplished."
198,"Hmm. Yes, I do have something you could do, actually. Lieutenant Doren and his followers up in the north need their regular supplies from us.They haven't been delivered, and with the trolls attacking, I'll need someone to do it. Doren's camp lies northwest of the road at the entrance to Stranglethorn from Duskwood. Give the supplies to Private Thorsen, if he's not in the camp, then he'll be patrolling south of it. He'll take care of them.Mind you, if you fail, you'll owe me restitution."
199,You take a sample of the strange smelling powder.
200,"If Kurzen knows Thorsen's secret, then we have a spy in our midst.  We must determine how the secret was leaked!Thorsen's contact within Kurzen's camp was Bookie Herod.  Herod is Kurzen's logistics officer and knows everything about the running of Kurzen's Compound.  If you can get Herod's notes or records, maybe we can find out how Thorsen was discovered.When we were still with Kurzen, Bookie's office was on the top floor of the camp's only two-story house.  His records are probably still there."
201,"I've gotten reports of a group of hunters that have set up camp upriver of the Venture Company mining camp on Lake Nazferiti.  Now, normally I wouldn't care, but improbably, I heard that Hemet Nesingwary Jr. was one of the hunters there.  He's certainly well-connected, if you catch my meaning, and you never can be too safe.Why don't you go check out the camp, <name>, see what they're about?"
202,"You have proven yourself time and again, and your resourcefulness seems to rival even that of Kurzen himself.  You may be the salvation of our band of rebels...if you can pit yourself against Kurzen and prevail!He commands his men from deep within the Stockpile.  You must enter that cave, brave through his defenders, and face Kurzen and his leaders.Farewell, <name>.  My hope, and the fate of my men, go with you."
203,"We're fighting a losing battle with Colonel Kurzen.  Not only is he a brilliant tactician, he outnumbers us at least 10 to 1!  To survive, we need to use his own, covert tactics against him.Enter his camp to the east and kill his men.  Lots of them.  And get out before reinforcements can close on you."
204,"To have a chance against Kurzen, we need his healing support neutralized.  He has gathered a large number of Medicine Men who heal his forces with Jungle Remedies and poison our fighters with Venom Fern Extracts.We need those remedies and extracts for our own.  Search the Kurzen Compound - his Medicine Men and Jungle fighers will have the remedies, and the extracts are probably stowed in some of the camp's supply boxes."
205,"While I study those legends you acquired, gather for me implements of evil troll magic.  Enter the territory of the Skullsplitter trolls, a second tribe to the distant south, and acquire Skullsplitter Fetishes from their Witchdoctors and Mystics."
206,"Kurzen may be dead, but...that which drove him to evil still lives!  Through my studies I have discovered this: An Ogre Mage - Mai'Zoth - dwells in an Ogre Mound within the eastern mountains of Stranglethorn.  He is rumored to employ mind-controlling magic, and I am positive that he corrupted Kurzen.If Mai'Zoth is allowed to live, then his evil may influence others, and may even cause another Kurzen to surface.Kill him, and bring me his Mind's Eye, the artifact he uses to corrupt others."
207,"Colonel Kurzen was once a great, noble man - I must find what caused his fall into depravity!  He may be under the sway of troll magic.  To confirm this, I must study some of their legends.There are 4 tablets hidden within the troll ruins of Stranglethorn.  I must see what is written on these tablets!  Transcribe their markings and bring the transcriptions back to me.The first tablet is in the Bal'lal Ruins, the second is in the Vile Reef, and the third and fourth are in the Ruins of Zul'Kunda."
208,"<name>, you are a hunter worthy of our company.  From the battlefields of Lordaeron to the deepest jungle, I have rarely witnessed such prowess with weaponry as you have demonstrated.You have killed the ferocious Sin'Dall, the elusive Bag'thera and the treacherous Tethis.  But the true prize is the head of King Bangalash.  That white tiger is the reason I am here.  I've had my sights on him for quite some time now.  Kill King Bangalash and your hunting prowess is proven to be second to none."
209,"It's expensive and hard to kill enough tigers to support the export of tiger fangs to the islands in the South Seas. Luckily, we've developed a technique that allows us to take mundane horn-like objects and turn them into undetectable forgeries.The closest match we've found, amazingly, are the tusks of the Skullsplitter trolls.Hey, before you say anything, what the buyer doesn't know doesn't hurt them, am I right? Bring me a large number of them so we can get to work on the monthly shipment!"
210,"I do most of the cooking at the camp.  And it used to be a lot of work, until I bought a mechanical cooking pot from a goblin merchant in Booty Bay.  The pot is a wonder!  It saved me countless hours...until it broke!Can you take the pot back to the goblin for me so he can fix it?  His name is Krazek."
211,"Alas, the time to attack Andorhal and drive out the lich that controls it is upon us!Inside the ruins of the city is where the lich - Araj the Summoner - holds dominion.  He is guarded by numerous Scourge surrounding the remains of city's center, and his personal retinue of guardians attached to him directly is formidable.  You will need numerous allies to even stand a chance of facing him successfully.Destroy Araj, <name>, and bring me a shard from his phylactery as proof!"
212,"One of my most famous dishes is Chilled Basilisk in Lime Vinaigrette.  But the problem is... the meat is impossible to keep fresh, and I must serve the dish tonight for a noble's birthday!So if you can bring me a Chilled Basilisk Haunch from a freshly-killed Cold Eye Basilisk, quickly, then I will owe you a king's feast!Cold Eye Basilisks are known to roam along the beach dunes of northwestern Stranglethorn, so you have much traveling to do.  And be swift!"
213,"He's done it this time! Bad enough that Gelriz's muscling out the moguls who were appointed by the trade princes, now he tries to cut in on the most notorious pirate!Revilgaz won't have it, and he's told me to take care of the problem in my own way.My way? Theft. The Venture Co. geologists near Lake Nazferiti are deeply interested in those strange blue crystals they have been finding in the mines. Bring me samples of the stone from their geologists, I don't care what you have to do to get them."
214,"It's no secret that the trademark of the Defias Gang is their Red Bandanas.  But we've learned that the material from which these bandanas are made signifies the member's rank.That being said, I want you to eliminate as many high ranking Defias members as you can.  The highest ranking members will undoubtedly be found in VanCleef's secret hideout.  When you're done bring me 10 Red Silk Bandanas as proof of their deaths and I will reward you.  Good luck, <name>."
215,"Thank you for saving me, <name>.  I know how this looks, but...allow me to explain.I was charged by Lieutenant Doren to re-enlist with Kurzen's men, so that I might spy on them and bring sorely needed intelligence to the rebels.  You saw here what I had thought would be my chance to infiltrate Kurzen's Compound.  I was wrong, and again, thanks for saving me.This was a top secret mission, so you must tell no one.  But if you speak with Doren he will explain."
216,"The Thistlefur furbolgs are threatening our expansion!  Thistlefur Village to our east blocks the way between us here and the Splintertree Post.  It's a path that would circumvent the village of Astranaar; without it, we give the Alliance an extra expansion path.<name>, we must not allow... an expansion path gap!Proceed to Thistlefur Village and thin out the furbolgs.  You will be given compensation for this task, but more importantly you will be doing your duty for the Horde!"
217,"<name>, our scouts have identified the leader of this recent Trogg incursion.  It appears that these beasts in Loch Modan are following the lead of a chieftain named Grawmug.  Grawmug is heavily guarded, however.  Two of his most elite guards, Gnasher and Brawler, never leave his side.If you feel yourself worthy, <name>, I want you to lead the assassination mission on Grawmug and his two thugs.  With the Trogg leadership dead, we just might stand a chance at pushing these beasts back into the ground."
218,"My journal! They took it away to the cave. The one that had it... It was a big brute with some odd markings on his skin and face. I didn't get a much better look than that.You've had some luck with the trolls, maybe you could go get it back for me?"
219,"At last, friends of the Alliance!Help... please...The last thing I remember these foul Orcs overpowered our regiment.  Most the men were killed. I took a strong blow to the head and everything went black. Now I am held captive in this cave.  Help me, I am hurt badly.I'll need help getting back to town... please... you're my last hope..."
220,Islen will have one more task for you before rewarding you with your next totem. The vial of water I've given you is necessary for whatever that task is.Go now and find her. We shall meet again some day.
221,"You might have noticed some larger worgen wandering around with the Shadow Weavers in the woods? From what we can tell, these Dark Runners make up the bulk of the worgen numbers.On my rangings, I've also noticed that they have overrun the Rotting Orchard southwest of town. These worgen are a bit tougher than the last you faced.Be on your guard."
222,"Your previous accomplishments have convinced me that you are ready to take on the toughest worgen infesting the woods.Of the worgen that have made their new home here, the Vile Fangs and the Tainted Ones have proven the most dangerous. They've settled down near some of the caves and in the mine to the south.From far away you can even see the light from their bonfires..."
223,"Here you go, <name>. Bring this message to Master Carevin.<He quickly removes a piece of faded parchment and offers it to you.>A few more like you, and we will outnumber the Night Watch! Perhaps then we could complete the work that we few carry on today."
224,"We need to protect the Loch, <name>!  With so many of the King's soldiers fighting valiantly on remote battlefields, we've become overwhelmed on the home front.  Troggs are tunneling up from every crevice!  The Trogg infestation poses the largest threat to Ironforge.  These disgusting mutants must be destroyed.We need you, brave adventurer, to venture forth and lay waste to the Trogg threat.  Slay 10 Stonesplinter Troggs and 10 Stonesplinter Scouts and report back."
225,"The weathered grave marker reads simply:MORGAN LADIMORE<Upon further examination, you notice that dirt over the grave has been recently disturbed, and that a good amount of the dirt seems to have been displaced...>"
226,"Sven and I have dangerous days ahead of us, what with the Necromancer to the east and all.  And out here alone as we are, we have to hunt for our own food.  It seems every time I'm heading back to camp with some meat on me, starving or rabid dire wolves come out of the forest wanting a bite.  It goes without saying, living out here is dangerous work!But if you can rid us of some of those wolves, we'd have an easier time of it.  They mostly prowl north and east of here, near the river."
227,"<He searches through the shelves and comes up with a leatherbound book.>If you would like to know more, you might ask Althea, she's been the one to handle the... trouble... with him of late."
228,"From what my scouts tell me, Mor'Ladim wanders throughout Duskwood, following a strange and meandering path through the cemetery. We buried him out past the house on the hill, you know where that is?There isn't anything I can do to help you, but I wish you good luck."
229,"I should have told you this earlier...How do I put this...Morgan may have believed that his family was all dead, but, in fact, his daughter Sarah Ladimore is now a Watcher. She's always been troubled by the... circumstances... surrounding her father's death. Perhaps you could go to bring the news to her."
230,"Digging through the mound, you find a small, dirt-stained book.The book has no title, but...it has information Sven would like to know."
231,"Here, take this and lay it on his grave. Maybe... somehow, he'll know that I'm okay, and that none of us hold him responsible for what happened.<There are tears in her eyes now, as she slides a ring from her right hand, and presses it into your hands.>And... thank you, <name>."
232,"The Royal Apothecary Society needs your assistance.  Listen closely, and both of us may profit from my plan.Apothecary Keever in the next room may be... touched... but his research does potentially bear fruit if it were pursued by a clever researcher.  Fortunately, I am such a researcher.  I want you to take this purchase order to Alessandro Luca, the proprietor of Blue Moon Odds and Ends; he'll give you a testing kit.  When you have it, bring it back to me and I'll outline your task in detail."
233,"Hm, I don't suppose you'd be willing to do a favor for me, < lad / lass>? A stack of letters came through the pass today, but I don't have the time to send them along.They're all addressed to Talin Keeneye. You can find him to the west down the road. He's set up camp next to the frozen lake.What do you say?"
234,"If I remember correctly, Grelin's camp is down the road to the southeast. No doubt he'll be eager to get his mail."
235,"Attention, young adventurers!  The wilds of Ashenvale await you!The Horde has established a strong presence in the lands north of the Barrens.  Our two outposts - Splintertree Post and the Zoram Strand Outpost - strive to bring glory to the Horde!  Those who would prove themselves should seek out guidance there.  Of note: Senani Thunderheart in Splintertree Post, directly north of the Barrens, seeks adventurers willing to take part in a great hunt of Ashenvale!"
237,"Mountaineer Cobbleflint had nothing but good things to say about you, <race>.  For that reason I am going to entrust upon you a mission of utmost importance.  We need to keep pressure on the invading Trogg forces until our Dwarven brethren return from the Alliance front.Set forth into the southern hills and kill 10 Stonesplinter Skullthumpers and 10 Stonesplinter Seers.  Your attacks will buy us some time.  Report back when your mission is complete."
238,"The kit is ready, <name>.  No doubt that Apothecary Zinge will want this as soon as possible.  Take it to her without delay, and let her know that I will add the cost of the kit to the Society's tab.  Also, please extend to her my warmest salutations.Well, don't just stand there.  Such is the life of a simple courier, yes?"
239,"The Garrison on our western border sends word of increasing gnoll and thief activity.  They're requesting we send more Stormwind soldiers... but we just don't have any to spare!If you can help, we could use it.  Go and speak with Deputy Rainer at the Westbrook Garrison and see what he needs done.The Garrison is down the road to the west.  After you cross the bridge over the small brook it will be to the right."
240,"And here we are - ""Crab"" Cakes ala Grual!"
243,"You will be headed to the Tanaris desert, testing the tissue consistency of the basilisks, scorpids, and hyena native there.  Obtain tissue samples and use them with the testing kit in tow; expect a chunk of the samples to fail.  I need eight acceptable samples of each creature type.In addition, the goblins of Gadgetzan have a power source that must be used with this kind of modified kit.  Speak to Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle and acquire one for the kit.Return to me only when you are successful."
244,"Hail, <class>.  I am charged to patrol this stretch of road.  Although the road is safe for now, I've seen gnoll encampments to the north and east of here.Lakeshire must know of the gathering gnoll force!  Report to Deputy Feldon in Lakeshire and tell him of the gnolls.  Do this, and I'm sure Feldon will offer you a scout's wage.Feldon's usually inspecting the area south of the bridge to Lakeshire."
245,"Hail, <class>. Perhaps you've seen those spiders that have taken over the western border? The eight-legged menaces are too much for us to handle, and the Commander hasn't enough manpower to spare so far from Darkshire.I hate to ask this of you, but you seem like you might be able to handle them. I can't promise you anything of great value, but I can reward you if you can help root out the filthy bugs.Oh, and a word of advice, you'll want to avoid their venom if you can."
246,"We don't have men to spare, but something must be done about those gnolls you reported to me.Scout southern Redridge for gnolls.  Harry them, kill those you can and report back to me with a count of their numbers and an assessment of the threat they present.  You may find those gnolls camped all along the southern road of Redridge.Do this for the Stormwind Army, <name>, and you will be rewarded."
248,"I have been watching the Tower of Ilgalar, and can detect that Morganth is in conflict with the Orcs in Stonewatch Keep.  I do not know the reason behind their contention, but you may aid me in unraveling this mystery.Take another Glyph of Azora, then go to the top of the intact watch tower beside Stonewatch Keep.Find a suitable object on which to place the Glyph.  A chest or a jar -- some place where the glyph will not be noticed -- will suit my purpose."
249,"After much observation, I have discovered Morganth's plans.He searches for the Scythe of Elune...and he may have found it!  If he has, then the Redridge Mountains, and the kingdom of Stormwind, will soon feel his dark might.I am not prepared to pit myself against Morganth, but I fear he must be dealt with now.  So you must enter the Tower of Ilgalar and face Morganth.Defeat him, and bring me his Pendant of Shadow.  Do this, and the kingdom will owe you much."
250,"Thank the stars someone is concerned about the well-being of the Dam.  First the destruction of the Thandol Span and then the pillaging of Dun Modr!  I have no doubt that the Dam will be the target of the next Dark Iron threat.  Most of the security detail here was reassigned to the Alliance Front, including my top inspector.That's why I need you, <name>.  I spotted some Dark Iron Sappers milling about the eastern ramp of the Dam.   Investigate the area and bring back a clue."
251,"Take the note you gave me to Sirra Von'Indi.  He's very learned in languages and ancient arts - if anyone here can translate this message, it's he."
252,"Oh my!  If what is written on this note is true, then Abercrombie's done something...unspeakable.You better bring the translated note back to Ello.And do so quickly, for I fear a doom already lumbers toward our town..."
253,"The Embalmer is a name told in one of our children's stories.  He was a kindly alchemist, driven mad by the death of his wife, Eliza.  To restore her, he used dark magic to place his own heart within the bosom of his dead spouse.This revived Eliza...but it cursed her with a hunger for human flesh, forcing the Embalmer to keep her buried.His heart is his power.  Find his wife's grave, retrieve his heart, and bring it to me while it still beats.  Do this and his power will be broken."
255,"Two months just to hear from Ironforge that we'll be spared a handful of soldiers for our own defense, and another two months until they arrive! Bad enough that our town goes unprotected, but the excavation and the dam--the dam!--are open to attacks as well.I've no choice then, it seems. I'll need hired arms.How about you? You seem a likely sort, <class>. A group of ogres has set up camp on the northeast of the lake. Perhaps you will be the one to remove the threat to our town?"
256,"By order of the Magistrate of Thelsamar:Chok'sul, the ogre presumed to be the leader and coordinator of attacks against the town of Thelsamar, Stonewrought Dam, and the excavation site, is wanted dead through any means necessary.Monetary compensation will be provided when proof is brought to the Magistrate of Chok'sul's death.Chok'sul was last seen at the ogre encampment in the northeastern part of Loch Modan."
257,"Think you can match wits with Daryl the Bold, huh? I should think not! Of course, you're more than welcome to try. Here's a challenge that should prove to be above your abilities, so don't feel too bad if you can't face up to it.A flock of buzzards has nested here in Loch Modan. Why don't you try to take down some of the beasts? Tell you what, if you meet my challenge in fifteen minutes, I'll give you my bow or gun.<He looks you over dismissively.>It seems you haven't much to lose, anyways."
258,"<name>ath, is it? I can tell you're bursting with pride over completing the first test, hm? As I told you before, it's no large feat.You should try your hand at boar hunting. Trust me, this is no Coldridge Valley boar hunt, so you'd best have a care with them. I'll give you just twelve minutes this time.Don't feel bad if you fail. I'd give you the shirt off my back if you succeeded!Have I ever related to you the story of how I received my famous scar? No? It was two years ago..."
261,"I will be frank.  We are at war with the Scourge.  It is an evil that corrupts our people and infects our land.  It must be stopped before it overwhelms us and drags our world into shadow.  We of the Scarlet Crusade have sworn to fight the Scourge with body and soul.If you are with us, then gather your courage and prove your allegiance--destroy the undead ravagers of Desolace, in the Valley of Bones to the south.Do this, and the Crusade will embrace you."
262,"I must know who was that skulker in the shadows I saw the night my family was killed!Please, <name>, you have shown your resourcefulness.  Please find that shadowy figure.  I must learn what secrets he holds!I do not have clues that you do not already know, but here - take the book you found at my farm.  Perhaps some of the townsfolk can link this book with its owner."
263,"The Mountaineers tell me you are quite brave and capable, <name>.  We need a <race> like you around here.  The Trogg problem isn't getting any better.  The reserves have been called to the front and we're all alone out here.  But now that we have a seasoned <class> here, let's see what you can do.Go out and kill 10 Stonesplinter Shaman and 10 Stonesplinter Bonesnappers.  Let's see if you live up to your reputation, Trogg-Slayer."
264,"Filthy scum! Leaves me for his damn crusade. Because ""the Light is the most important thing we have against the threats the undead pose.""Well, what about his children?! What about ME?! Night after night I sat patiently waiting for him... always second to his blasted duty!Well, witness what ""justice"" brings you, <name>! He's dead and I'm bearing the very thing he was trying to stop!Take this piece of junk and put it on his tomb at the Sepulcher. I want nothing to do with it anymore... or him!"
265,"Here is your book back, <name>, and I bid you fortune with your search.  If you ask others in town, perhaps they can offer you more clues.And here is one more for you - although the author of this book is a stranger to Darkshire, the book itself was purchased here."
266,"Here is your book, and good luck with your inquiries.You might want to expand your search to the inn.  If the person whom you seek spent time in town, then chances are someone saw him there."
267,"<class>, you may or may not be aware of the Trogg threat looming over Dwarven lands.  With the Ironforge Reserve called up to the Alliance Front, we are left with a fraction of the defense forces needed to keep these lands safe.  My regiment is assigned to watch over the Gate here and we cannot leave our post for fear of invasion.But we need some pressure put on those damned Troggs lurking in the hills.  If you're up to the task, wage an assault on the Troggs.  Bring me back 8 Trogg Stone Teeth as proof."
268,"The book you found was only half finished.  I had to leave it at Sven's farm when I fled there...Here.  Take my completed journal to Sven.  It describes more fully what happened at his farm.Although this journal has been my only company these past weeks, if giving it up keeps me from having to face Sven and his wrath, then I do it willingly!"
269,"Go to the city of Stormwind and speak with Bishop Farthing in the Cathedral of Light.  Give him Jitters' journal and tell him you mean to face Morbent Fel.Although Stormwind has forsaken Darkshire, Farthing is a kind soul and very wise.  He may help you on your quest to save us.Your mission is perilous, but hurry, <name>.  With each passing hour, the shadows of Duskwood grow ever darker."
270,"Years ago, the Third Fleet of Kul'Tiras sunk along the coasts of The Wetlands, an expanse of marsh north of the Dwarven kingdom of Ironforge.  Aboard one ship was a load of Lightforge Iron.This metal is precious to us, for items crafted from it strike with holy truth.  If you are to face Morbent Fel, then you will need such a weapon.Go to Menethil Harbor and speak with my dwarven colleague Glorin Steelbrow.  If that lost metal can be found, he'll know where to look."
271,"I don't suppose you'd be interested in a little payback for His Boldness? Daryl does have some skill, it pains me to say.A year ago, a large bear had been the target of the Farstrider Lodge, but none of the hunters had any luck with him. So, Daryl thought he'd try his hand against him. All he had to show for his effort was that ugly scar over his eye.Kill the bear, and I'm sure even Daryl would be speechless for once.The bear, Ol' Sooty, can be found around his lair in the hills over Thelsamar."
272,"For the second trial, you'll need the two halves that make the Pendant of the Sea Lion.  One half draws power from the agility of the sea lion aspect, gliding through water; the other draws power from the incredible endurance of the sea lion aspect.  Druids draw on both these traits equally to embody the aspect of their aquatic form.Speak with the locals of Moonglade to learn where the parts may lie, and bring both here to join them together.  Once formed, take the pendant to Dendrite Starblaze."
273,"It's not too late though, you're welcome to go look for Huldar. He can't have made it very far, strong as they are, Miran and Saean can only move so fast laden down with those barrels.They're taking the normal route to the site, leaving south out of town and following the curve of the Loch.Shouldn't have a problem finding them unless they've already gotten there."
274,"This ain't no ordinary blast powder.  Look at the tiny silver crystals.  And the distinct smell!  Why it's clear as daylight that this is Seaforium Powder.  Seaforium is harmless enough.  But once it's wet it could blow Ironforge out of the mountain.The chemical reaction can be defused by mixing four components:  lurker venom, crushed Mo'Grosh crystal, a crocolisk tear and this disarming colloid.  Now tell Hinderweir before it's too late!"
275,"I do not know why, but a festering grows within the Wetlands.  Fen Creepers have risen.  They are diseased, fevered blisters on the land, and for the fever to break they must be dispatched and allowed to settle back into the marshes.The Fen Creepers shamble amidst the waterways of the Wetlands."
276,"The Mosshide Gnolls have lived in the Wetlands peacefully for many years, but now grow in numbers.  Their feet stamp flat the fen's bushes and flowers, and their foul axes cut too much wood to fuel their fires.They are no longer in balance with the land.  For the Wetlands to survive, the Gnolls must be reduced.Kill 15 Mosshide Gnolls and 10 Mosshide Mongrels.  Hunt them to the south, near the Dwarven gate of Algaz.  After you do this, return to me."
277,"The Mosshides are cutting the trees of the Wetlands, using the trees' flesh to warm themselves with fire.  I will suffer this pain no longer!Rid the Mosshides of their crude flints, the tools they use to make fire.  The flints are borne by all Mosshides except the smaller Mosshide gnolls and Mosshide mongrels."
278,"Begin collecting the disarming materials immediately, <name>.  Lurker Venom can be found on the indigenous spiders in Loch Modan.  Crocolisk tears are found here in the Loch as well.  But a Mo'Grosh crystal will be very difficult to procure.  The ogres to the northeast mine them but the crystals are a very rare commodity.We need to be prepared to defuse a Dark Iron attack!  Return to me once you've collected the needed items and I will prepare the mixture."
279,"Murlocs are crawling out from the deep waters and building their villages on the coastline.  They are harassing our fishers and merchants and must be stopped.One of these murlocs, Gobbler, skulks with other bluegill murlocs and harries merchants along the road, always then retreating to the safety of the nearby murloc hovels.  Our merchants are in jeopardy, and we will pay to secure them.Gobbler prowls the river inlet north of here.  Find him, slay his kin, and bring me his head."
280,Earlier today I spotted some Dark Iron Insurgents swimming toward the Dam with a large keg.  No Mountaineers were on hand to stop them!  I'm afraid they've planted the Seaforium at the base of the Dam and it could blow at any minute!  Let me combine all these ingredients into the Disarming Mixture.  There we go.Now I need you to take this mixture and stir it into the keg before it's too late!  Hurry!
281,"Not long ago a merchant vessel, the Blind Princess, was raided by Murlocs.  Although the ship escaped intact, much of its cargo was dragged overboard by the creatures, including a very valuable statuette of Terenas Menethil.  We want that statuette recovered.Search the coastal Murloc hovels for crates, barrels and other evidence of lost cargo.  Find the Menethil Statuette and return it to me."
282,"I was planning on sending my apprentice to my brother Senir with my report, but I would feel much better were it placed in more... reliable hands. That is, of course, if you wouldn't mind?Hmm... you'll have to take the tunnel to get to Kharanos.Speak with Mountaineer Thalos before going through the tunnel. It's completely infested with troggs now.Follow the road back to Anvilmar, then keep heading east to the tunnel, Thalos is stationed nearby."
283,The keg fizzles slightly.
284,"You thoroughly search this cluster of Murloc hovels, and find no trace of the Menethil Statuette.Perhaps one of the two nearby hovels to the north and northeast will have more clues."
285,"This grouping of Murloc hovels, after a thorough inspection, reveals nothing....but you're certain that the next clue you find will be fruitful.One of the hovels to the north must have the Menethil Statuette!"
286,"After pulling the barrel free from the muck and opening it, a silvery figurine is found packed in fine straw.  It depicts a young, long-haired Paladin with hammer upraised.This must be the Menethil Statuette!  You must now return it to Karl Boran in Menethil Harbor."
287,"I'm behind on my report, and could use your help, <name>. I just managed to find where the trolls are holed up, but I saw so many trolls, I was afraid to go in.Here's what I need... Go down to the cave, poke around inside, kill a few of the trolls, then come back here.Take the road north out of Kharanos, when you get to the bridge, follow the frozen river west until you reach Iceflow Lake. You'll find Brewnall Village on the west bank. The Hold is southwest of the village."
288,"I was once First Mate on the Wave Mistress, ship-of-the-line in the Kul Tiras Third Fleet.  The Doomed Fleet.  Doomed, for on its last voyage the fleet was attacked  by Red Dragons.  Dragons controlled by Orcs!We didn't stand a chance against that dragonfire...and our fleet was burned and sunk off this here coast.  I'm the sole survivor of those poor vessels......Oh, my head hammers and pounds!  I'll need a fresh drink if I'm to get a handle on this hangover and continue my tale."
289,"<Bolstered, Fitzsimmons continues his tale...>I am the sole survivor of the ill-fated Third Fleet of Kul Tiras, wrecked off the coast to the north.  But although I'm the only member of the fleet still breathing, I'm not the only one still walking about!  For on one of our ships was hidden a great, and terrible treasure, and the eerie power of it keeps the souls of my brothers trapped within the ships' rotting hulls.But if you can free some of my brothers, then perhaps you can break their curse."
290,"To break the curse and free all of my brethren, the...thing...stowed on my ship must be retrieved and cleansed!  I don't know what it was, but I do know that it was stored securely in the ship's strongbox, which Captain Halyndor lorded over.My old captain is still in my dreams.  I know he walks my doomed ship, the Intrepid.  Get the key from him, and use it to open the Intrepid's strongbox.Then, after you have the cursed thing, bring it to the priest Glorin Steelbrow in town."
291,"Excellent! Take my report to Senator Barin Redstone. He's a sour type, so don't let his less-than-sunny disposition get to you. He's in Ironforge, in the chamber where King Magni holds court.Don't know the way to Ironforge? Take the road out of Kharanos north, cross the bridge, then follow the road east--there are large banners flanking the road--up the mountainside.By the way, if you might avoid mentioning how you assisted me? Can't let them think I'm not working hard out here, you know?"
292,"Opening the chest reveals a blackened orb, pulsing with an eerie light.  It is the treasure of which Fitzsimmons spoke: a Cursed Eye of Paleth.Take the Cursed Eye of Paleth to the dwarven priest Glorin Steelbrow, in Menethil Harbor.  Ask him how to remove the Eye's curse."
293,"I can't lift the curse from the Eye of Paleth.  The Eyes were crafted by Human Priests, so you'll have to go to Stormwind to find someone who can help you.  Speak with Archbishop Benedictus.  He is head of the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind.  He can help.I hope, for your sake."
294,"The situation is severe, that much is for sure.  When we uncovered these bones it attracted the Raptors.  These filthy beasts killed my brethren and trapped me, Merrin and the poor Prospector up here.Help clear the Wetlands of these Raptors, <name>.  Mottled Raptors and Mottled Screechers are just West of the bluff there.  Kill 10 of each, if you can.That will be a good start to the vengeance I have planned for them."
295,Now it's time to really make those dreaded Raptors regret their blood-thirst.  Just down below there are scores of Mottled Scytheclaws and Mottled Razormaws.  Make those rotten creatures pay by slaying 10 of each!
296,"While you were down there I happened to notice that one of those beasts stood out from the rest.  He was bigger and more menacing.  I bet he's the one who led the others here to cause the disruption to the dig site.I ask of you now one final task, <name>.  See to it that Sarltooth is brought to justice.  And considering the gravity of his crimes, justice in this case means death!  Bring me one of his talons as proof of his death."
297,"Recently, just before the Troggs surfaced within the site, we had uncovered a large number of strange, carved idols.  But we didn't have the chance to study them, for soon after their discovery the Troggs chased us away from the ruins!  And those idols have a strange effect on the Troggs.  It makes them go berserk!Bring me 8 idols - I want to study them, and I want them out of Trogg hands!  You can find the idols on the Troggs infesting the site."
298,"I need a progress report sent to Thelsamar - a progress report, and a restatement of my request for more blastpowder!  Here's the report.  Take it to Jern Hornhelm.  He's our local contact in Thelsamar.It's not a difficult task, but it must be done."
299,"Just before the invasion I uncovered a large tablet called the Goaz Stone.  The translated text breaks off in 4 places.  The text speaks of a ""divine plan"" and a ""doomed prophecy.""I fear we are running out of time.  I am too old to go down and brave those beasts.  But you are strong.Scour the excavation site and uncover the 4 missing tablet fragments: Ados, Modr, Golm and Neru.  Search for them in ancient artifacts or where the soil is loose.  Bring them to me so I can begin unlocking the mystery!"
301,"We'll need approval to get Ironband more blastpowder. You'll have to take his report to the Explorers' League headquarters in Ironforge.Here's the report. Give it to Prospector Stormpike, and don't forget to duck after you deliver it. Stormpike is hotheaded, and he won't be happy to hear of Ironband's slow progress at the site.You'll find Stormpike in the Assembly of Explorers."
302,"If Ironband still needs blastpowder, then by Magni he'll have it!  I sent the approval on ahead with a messenger to Jern Hornhelm in Thelsamar.  He'll prepare the powder and other supplies to take to Ironband.And one more thing: I want you to personally see that the shipment of powder reaches its destination.  The last one didn't, so keep your mind sharp and your eyes open."
303,"War rages both home and abroad.  While mighty Dwarven soldiers give their lives in far off territories in the name of the Alliance, our own lands fall prey to the evil deeds of the Dark Iron Dwarves.  They laid waste to the Thandol Span.  Dun Modr fell soon after.We need you to gather force and push the front back.  If you can kill 10 Dark Iron Dwarves, 5 Tunnelers, 5 Saboteurs and 5 Demolitionists, the reserve might arrive in time to finish the drive.Now make haste!"
304,"Many of my soldiers died in the battle of Dun Modr. My own brother perished when the West Bridge over the Thandol Span was destroyed.  Aye, the Dark Iron dwarves are a devilish breed.  From what Roggo was able to gather, the leader of the thugs in the Wetlands is a warlock named Balgaras the Foul. He is quite a coward, sending his soldiers to do his bidding but hides in his camp on Direforge Hill, to the southeast.If you can find the spineless scum, slay him and bring me his ear. I will reward you, <class>."
305,"Oh my, you must be the scout Longbraid said he would send!  You cannot imagine how worried I have been.My wife, Merrin, has been sending me letters each week for the past month.  She is part of the Whelgar Excavation team.  But it has been nearly two weeks since her last correspondence.  Surely something is wrong!Longbraid said that he would send a scout to check up on things if we did not hear from the team soon.  I assume that scout is you, <name>.  Find Merrin at the excavation site to the east!"
306,"It was horrible!  We were uncovering some rare artifacts and we began to discover these large bones.Before we knew what was happening, these Mottled Raptors overwhelmed the dig site.  Many lives were lost.Ormer here -- so brave -- saved the Prospector and me.  He defended us as we ran for shelter.  Now we are trapped.  And our hard work lies in ruin.Here, take this note back to my sweet Tarrel.  It will explain the situation to him."
307,"The Silver Stream Mine to the east ran dry long ago.  It was converted by the Miners' League into a storage depot, but now Kobolds have moved in, putting their filthy paws on good, Dwarven tools!We'll root out those vermin soon enough, but the League wants someone to get their gear out of the mine before we warriors tromp in there and break things.  It'll be a tough delve - you might want cohorts at your side.The gear is stored in Miners' League Crates throughout the mine.  Good luck."
309,"Ready to go, <name>?First, we need to get this powder to Ironband. It'll be a lot for me to carry, and these parts can get dangerous -- and who knows what else the Dark Irons might have in store for me.I'll feel a lot better with you coming along."
310,"I have to admit, those Thunderbrews make some good drinks.  But they need to learn that theirs isn't the only decent brew!  Maybe you can help me teach them that lesson...Here, take this barrel of Barleybrew Scalder.  Sneak into the basement of the Thunderbrew Distillery in Kharanos and switch it with one of their barrels of Thunder Ale.  Then we'll see how their patrons like my brew over theirs!And if the barrels are guarded, then you might have to distract the guard ..."
311,"Having inserted a barrel of Marleth's Scalder in the Kharanos Distillery's cellar, you grab a barrel of Thunder Ale as proof of the deed..."
312,"I had a month's worth of dried meats salted and locked away for the cold season.  Kept it locked so the bears wouldn't get it!  But while I was off hunting deer, that beast, Old Icebeard, made off with the meat locker.  He won't be able to smash through that Thorium though.  But I'll starve if I can't get my meats back.You seem a bit more stealthy than me.  Perhaps you can retrieve my stash?  I'll never make it in and out of that cave fast enough with this bum leg of mine."
313,"Driving a Siege Engine isn't for everyone.  It takes an iron grip and nerves of steel...lucky I have both!  How about you?  How's your mettle?  Want to prove it to me?Well...I'm looking to make my engine, Trollplow, a little more cozy.  How about you get me a heap of Wendigo Manes from the Grizzled Den, west of Kharanos.  Those manes would make a great rug for Trollplow's inside deck!"
314,"We heard the cries in the middle of the night.  Then this morning, sure enough, the herd was missing two rams.  That dastardly beast known as Vagash has been preying on our livelihood.  With most of King Magni's army off in distant lands fighting with the Alliance, there is no one to keep Vagash at bay.Perhaps you are brave enough to seek out the beast and slay him.  Bring me one of his fangs and I will reward you.  Vagash lurks just above the ranch here, but be warned, he is deadly."
315,"I'm on a quest, a quest to make the perfect stout.  I know I can do it -- brewing's in my blood.  I just need to find the right recipe...The Frostmane trolls grow a plant, shimmerweed, high up in the hills to the east.  They use it in their strange, tribal rituals.  We dwarves haven't found much use for it, but it has a unique taste...and I want to experiment with it in my brews!Get me some shimmerweed from Frostmane seers, or swipe it from the trolls' shimmerweed baskets."
317,"I'm preparing to start a mission for the Siege Brigade.  It's a long one, and I need to stock Jetsteam with a month's worth of supplies.  So while Steelgrill is working on my tank, can you do some hunting for me?I'll need some fur for bedding, and boar meat for food.  You can get meat from boars and fur from the bears... you can find them both in the snow fields south of the Grizzled Den."
318,"Rejold Barleybrew experiments with his brews.  Some of them taste good, some bad, and some...well, some will lay all but the stoutest dwarf flat.He lives at Brewnall Village, west of Kharanos, and one of his drinks, Evershine, is what I want.  It'll help keep me warm while I'm on the cold road.And...the blessed stuff burns so hot I can throw it in Jetsteam's furnace for a burst of power!  That little tactic has gotten me out of more than one tight spot."
319,"I have a cask of Evershine handy, but...can you do me a favor?  Brewnall village could use a hand against the wild animals that wander the nearby snows.  Sometimes they wander close.We're not afraid of these bears and cats and boars - no self respecting dwarf would be - but if you can take care of those animals for us, then we'd have more time for our crafting and brewing."
320,"Here's your cask of Evershine, <name>.  And again, thank you for the hunting earlier."
321,"The shipwrecks off the shore here are the doomed Third Fleet of Kul'Tiras, burned and sunk by Red Dragons during the last Great War.The Fleet hailed from Lordaeron, but one ship, an Elvish Destroyer: Flying Osprey, was with it.  It was shipping a load of Lightforge Iron and joined the Third Fleet for protection.  Ironic that it sunk to the same dragons...Enough history.  The Flying Osprey is wrecked to the south of Menethil Harbor.  If you find the Lightforge Iron there, bring it to me."
322,"There is a dwarven weaponsmith in the Dwarven District of Stormwind who can craft with lightforge iron.  His name is Grimand Elmore.I've packed the iron you found into a crate.  Take it to Grimand and tell him your tale.  I'm sure he'll oblige someone on a quest such as yours, and craft for you a weapon - a weapon to give even Morbent Fel worry!"
323,"Morbent Fel is a necromancer, and an ally to the dark riders.  I would pit you against the power of Morbent Fel, but I will not send you against that vile fiend without first knowing your strength.You have already proven your bravery to me, but if you truly wish to face the necromancer, then you must now prove your skill against his minions."
324,"Having grabbed the single lightforge ingot from the waterlogged chest, it is clear that murlocs have stolen the rest.  Hunt the murloc raiders near the Flying Osprey wreckage for the lost lightforge iron."
325,"Here is the weapon against the fiend of which you spoke.  You're all ready, <name>.  Best of luck to you, and I look forward to your tale of glory!"
328,"Although no mention of Private Thorsen is found in these records, hidden within the binding of one of Herod's ledger books is a small, brass key.And after further study of his notes, a few references to a ""secure strongbox"" are contained among various papers.  The box is somewhere within the Stockpile - the cavern complex at the back of Kurzen's Compound.If this secure strongbox is found, and the small brass key can open it, then perhaps the mystery behind Thorsen's detection will be revealed."
329,"Among the valuables of the strongbox is a muddy, scribbled note.  Although barely legible, it looks to be an itinerary for Private Thorsen.  It details his patrol routes, who he speaks with and how he spends his time with the rebels.  It's signed with only one letter: -M.But whoever wrote this note must have stayed very close to Thorsen.  Whoever wrote this note is the traitor within the rebel camp."
330,"The note you gave me is signed with an ""-M""...I don't know what that could mean.But...the note also says this person shared patrol routes with Thorsen last week.  So whoever shared patrol with Thorsen last week must be the traitor!Go to Corporal Sethman.  He handles the patrol schedules and can tell you who was with Thorsen."
331,Did Lieutenant Doren want you to report back to him with that patrol information?
332,"If you talk to anyone about wine, then you know we Gallinas sell the best wine in Stormwind.  And we're not far, still in the Trade District along the city's lovely canals.Here, take this pamphlet.  Bring it to my sister Suzetta at our shop for a complimentary bottle of our famous pinot noir.  You won't regret it!"
333,"We've been doing a lot of business lately.  It seems like everyone is buying armor and sturdy clothes.  Almost like they expect a cold, harsh season ahead...But those are future worries.  My worry today is that I'm running out of knitted clothing to sell.  I need another load from our supplier.If you can take this request to Rema Schneider at the Canal Tailor and Fit Shop, I'd be most grateful."
334,"My son Thurman is an apprentice at the Larson Clothiers, in the Mage's Quarter.  He was in a hurry today and forgot his shears and needles.  I know a great <class> like you must have important tasks at hand, but without his tools Thurman can't do his apprentice work!Please, <name>.  Can you take my son's sewing kit to him?  Larson Clothiers is one of two clothing shops in the Mage's Quarter - it's the one deeper in, near the Mage's Tower."
335,"Lord Wishock is causing quite a stir amongst the House of Nobles.  He was made aware of our little ""establishment"" down here and is lobbying for a full investigation.  I have a plan to keep Wishock ""preoccupied,"" but I'll need your help.There is a flower growing in the Garden of Stalvan on the outskirts of Darkshire.  This small white flower is known as the Tear of Tilloa.  I will also need a Musquash Root, found only at the very base of the falls far beneath the Stonewrought Dam in the Wetlands."
336,"Lord Wishock, like all men, has his weaknesses.  His happens to be a fondness for liquor.  The hypocrisy is astounding.  The trite fool spends his days trying to shut down our little ""tavern"" while his nights are spent upstairs, running up a bill he never pays.  Well, let's see how Wishock likes this special brew I have prepared for him:  Black Claw stout.  It's got quite a kick, <name>.Take it to him and see how he likes it.  Most likely the old fool is milling about the Hall of Petitioners."
337,"Although the cover of this book is marred by scratches and caked with mud, the words ""The History of Stormwind"" can still be read along its spine.  Upon opening the book, the seal of the Stormwind Library is clearly stamped on the book's first page.It looks like someone checked out this book, and never returned it..."
338,"Master Nesingwary will be so upset if he finds out!He trusted me to proofread the manuscript of his novel, The Green Hills of Stranglethorn.  Everything was going well, but a large gust of wind blew through the camp and scattered the pages everywhere!I was able to gather most of the pages but many are still strewn about the jungle.  Collect the pages to complete each of the four chapters.I will help you organize them.  Return the chapters to me once you have all four."
339,"Chapter I was quite riveting!  Master Nesingwary sets the backdrop for the story and makes mention of his hunting companions, including me!But that's besides the point.  Let me see which pages are still missing.  It seems pages 1, 4, 6 and 8 are still out there somewhere in the jungle!"
340,"Chapter II was chock full of exciting tales of panther and tiger hunting.  I could just kick myself for letting the pages blow away!It seems I was able to recover all of the pages with the exception of pages 10, 11, 14, and 16."
341,"Chapter III was my favorite.  It tells of Sir Erlgadin and Lady Rouack's first kill with a dwarven rifle.  And the end of Chapter III, why, such a cliffhanger!Looks to me as though we still need pages 18, 20, 21 and 24 to finish the chapter.  Those pages are out there somewhere. . ."
342,"Ah Chapter IV; the big finale!  And what an ending it was!We are only missing three pages for this chapter.  We need pages 25, 26 and 27 to put Chapter IV back together."
343,"I'm giving a speech on the Fortitude of the Spirit, and I'd like to recite passages from a particular book on metallurgy - ""The Stresses of Iron.""  A copy of this book should be in the Royal Library, within Stormwind Keep.  Can you retrieve it for me?  If so, then may the blessings of the Light be with you!The Royal Library is very large, but the head librarian, Milton Sheaf, knows each shelf like it was his own son.  Speak to him, he'll retrieve the book for you."
344,"The Stresses of Iron?  Yes, I know the book.  Quite a good one, written by the Dwarven miner Margulf Blaggon a few decades ago.  He spent most his time deep in the mountains of Khaz Modan, digging ore.  Smart fellow!But where was I?  Oh yes, the Stresses of Iron!  I'm afraid the book was moved to the Northshire Abbey.  The caretaker of the Abbey's library, Brother Paxton, wanted to make a copy of the book for his own shelves.But that was months ago.  I wonder why it's taking him so long..."
345,"I've been meaning to finish my copy of The Stresses of Iron, but...Well you see, I make my own ink for books I copy.  It's my own recipe; it doesn't run or smear, and it dries very quickly  Unfortunately, it dries too quickly!  My last batch dried up before I could finish the copying job, and I haven't had the chance to make more ink!To make more I need Rethban Iron Ore from the Redridge Mountains.  Foreman Oslow in Lakeshire is my usual supplier."
346,"Now that I've finished copying the book, here's the original Stresses of Iron.  Thank you for your patience, and if you see Milton please tell him I'm sorry for the long delay."
347,"Rethban Ore is named after the man who first found it, Bart Rethban.  When smelted it's not as strong as iron, but its ore has a dark, flat color that some scribes use in their dyes.  It can be found in the Rethban Caverns, north of here.We usually have some in stock, but we're too busy preparing for Orc attacks to gather any.  And besides...Redridge Gnolls are now living in the Rethban Caverns and their Drudgers are gathering the ore themselves.So if you need some, you'll have to get it yourself."
348,Sick...so...very s-s-sick.......have contracted Stranglethorn Fever...deadly v-v-virus......only cure...is...is...to eat the heart of M-m-m-m-mokk the Savage...elusive white beast......Witch doctor Unbagwa...only one who can s-s-summon.......seek Unbagwa in hidden cave on southern cape......hurry...dying...dying....
349,"Hi, <name>!Speak with me friend Witch Doctor Unbagwa."
350,"That Marzon would be contacting a member of the Defias and have ties to Lescovar...Having killed VanCleef and Thredd, it would be hard to see Lescovar brought to proper justice, as your evidence is nothing without their testimonies. That is not even considering the fact that Lescovar is a noble and well connected. It effectively makes him above the law.You'll need other help. I loathe to do so, but there is someone I know that will aid us. You'll find Trias in the Trade District of the city."
351,"You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.""The name's Oglethorpe, and my homing robot has gone missing!  I will reward you for its recovery!  Please take this beacon to the robot.  Excellent, I now have computed the coordinates for you!  It crashed near the Gaping Chasm in Tanaris!"""
353,"The Stormpikes are a respected dwarven clan, and are well known for their fine and discerning tastes.  So it's no wonder that Gringer Stormpike, a Mountaineer of Ironforge, commissioned me to craft him a weapon.The weapon is finished, but... Mountaineer Stormpike is far away, in distant Loch Modan.  If you plan on traveling to the north, can you deliver this package to him?My last message from Mountaineer Stormpike said he's stationed at the northern guard tower in Loch Modan."
354,"The Agamand family was the most prosperous family in Tirisfal Glades.  I used to work their mills...before the Plague.When the Scourge first came, the Agamands fortified their home and convinced those in their employ to remain and help them defend.  We were fools, but at least we were loyal fools.The Agamands, in their pride, doomed us to undeath.  And now they are minions of the Scourge!Serve the Forsaken by defeating the Agamands who fell to the Plague.  Serve me by bringing me their remains."
355,"You have given me the remains of the Agamands, and satisfied my desire for revenge.  But the Agamand Mills hold a threat to all the Forsaken, not just to me.I have spoken to Magistrate Sevren of your exploits against the Agamands, and he wishes to speak with you."
356,"The defenders on The Bulwark protecting Tirisfal from the Plaguelands are on constant alert.  But sometimes Scourge will slip past them.Our success at the Bulwark depends on a one-front battle - we cannot allow an attack from the rear, nor can we allow our defenders' supply line to be cut.Assist the Bulwark.  Patrol east and slay any Scourge you find.  Spend particular effort at the Balnir Farmstead to the east.  It has become a haven for interloping Scourge."
357,"There is a lich who dwells on the island in Brightwater Lake to the north.  Although he is a free-willed Forsaken, he believes all other Undead are Scourge slaves and has his minions attack anyone who approaches him.But because he is Forsaken, the Queen will want him.  And if he is skilled in Necromancy, then his knowledge would be...quite useful to us.To discover his identity and his talents, I must see his spellbook.  Steal into his camp and acquire it, then return to me."
358,"The Mass Graves, southwest of Garren's Haunt to the north, were made to accommodate the...impressive...number of deaths Tirisfal suffered when the Plague first came.The bodies in these graves have so far been spared an undeath, but the Scourge now send Rot Hide Gnolls to gather the corpses and use them to bolster their armies.  This cannot be allowed!Your task is twofold: slay the Rot Hides at the Mass Grave and Garren's Haunt, and gather from them the Embalming Ichor that gives them life."
359,"I need a fresh report from our Deathguard waystation to the east.I must know if more Scourge forces have slipped past The Bulwark and into Tirisfal.  Our vigilance on the border to the Plaguelands must be maintained - we can't let the Scourge get a stronger foothold here!Travel south along the road, then east at the fork to the waystation.  Speak with Deathguard Linnea.  She has the information I need."
360,"Now return to Magistrate Sevren with the information I gave you.  He'll want it as soon as possible, so be swift.And if you see any Scourge on your way back, take them down - we can't let them wander our lands unchallenged."
361,"This is a letter written by Thurman, the eldest son of Gregor Agamand.  It is addressed to an Yvette Farthing, though it does not appear to have reached her..."
362,"Devlin Agamand was the younger of two sons in the Agamand family, and in life the two could not be more different.  Thurman was tall and gentle while his younger brother was weak and sharp tongued.When Agamand Mills fell to the Plague, I was not surprised to hear that Devlin was quick to succumb.  His mad chattering can still be heard near the road leading to the Agamand Mills.I'm collecting the remains of the Agamands, and I want poor Devlin.  Find him, destroy him, and bring me his bones."
363,"About time you woke up. We were ready to toss you into the fire with the others, but it looks like you made it.I am Mordo, the caretaker of the crypt of Deathknell. And you are the Lich King's slave no more.Speak with Shadow Priest Sarvis in the chapel at the base of the hill, he will tell you more of what you must know."
364,"We Forsaken are at war with the Lich King's army of the Scourge: necromantically raised armies of the undead, foul beasts of the north, and tormented spectres.The northern part of the village has become overrun with the Mindless Ones, and they must be destroyed. Destroy them, show them no mercy, our former brothers and sisters as they might be. The Fallen are nothing but The Lich King's slaves."
365,"What have we here?  You look like a fledgling <class>.  If you hope to prove yourself to The Dark Lady, you need to learn the ways of The Forsaken.To the west you'll find a farm.  Humans infest the land like mold on a rotting corpse.  And worse yet, the Scarlet Crusade patrols nearby from their tower.  Teach those scum a lesson and steal 10 of their precious pumpkins.Once you have 10, take them to Apothecary Johaan in Brill."
366,"Long ago Gunther and I, along with the now Scourge Necromancer Thule Ravenclaw, were friends and students within the Kirin Tor - a society of mages in Dalaran.Gunther and I both fell to the Plague, but I thought he either remained dead, or was raised into the ranks of the Lich King.  It is good to know he is free.We must have him.  I have placed a spell on his book that, when he sees it, will show him that I too am free of the Lich King.  After knowing this, it is my hope that he will join us."
367,"Lady Sylvanas has called upon the Royal Apothecary Society. The Dark Lady believes our knowledge coupled with the newfound magic will provide the key to Arthas's demise.  She has challenged us to concoct a new plague, a plague deadlier than any ailment on Azeroth. This new disease will bring Arthas's Scourge Army to ruin.My studies show that the blood of beasts might prove to be the key. Bring to me 5 vials of darkhound blood so I can test my theory."
368,"While you were collecting samples for me, my experiments led me to realize that more reagents will be required for this new disease to spread properly. Poisoning some hapless victim is child's play. Plaguing an entire world proves to be a bit more complicated.I will need 5 Vile Fin Scales from Murlocs in the vicinity.  You will find the creatures along the coast to the north or to the west."
369,"While you were out gathering, I uncovered some old text in one of my tomes that indicates that an ancient plague wiped out thousands of innocent victims.  Later it was discovered that the deadly agent in the plague was preserved through the venom of Night Web Spiders.Bring me some venom from a Vicious Night Web Spider to complete this experiment.  I want to see if the contagious element from the venom will work with my new concoction.  Rumor has it the spiders can be found in Eastern Tirisfal Glades."
370,"The strategic documents from Executor Arren contain all the details we need to wipe the human infestation from the lands.  According to the information, The Scarlet Crusade has assigned Captain Perrine and a brigade to the ruined tower southwest of Brill.Kill Perrine along with 3 Zealots and 3 Missionaries and report back to me."
371,We are still at war and the Scarlet Crusade grows in strength.  The report Executor Arren sent me indicates Scarlet Crusaders have been raiding from the ruined tower in southeastern Tirisfal near the Balnir Farmstead under the command of Captain Vachon.Kill Vachon along with 5 Scarlet Friars. It should prove to be a devastating blow to the Crusade!
372,"Scarlet Crusaders have been raiding from the ruined tower in northern Tirisfal, past Faol's Rest.  According to the information we have, a ruthless commander named Captain Melrache is in charge of this evil crew.I am entrusting you now with a special and dangerous mission.  Slay Melrache and his two bodyguards, in the name of The Dark Lady."
373,"Searching Edwin VanCleef's person, you discover, among other things, an unsent letter. It is addressed to Baros Alexston, the City Architect of Stormwind, City Hall, Cathedral Square.It appears to be recently written and sealed."
374,"Executor Zygand tells me you've been out killing Scarlet Crusaders. Tirisfal Glades is crawling with them.Varimathras, lieutenant to The Dark Lady, is seeing to it personally that the scum of Azeroth, the Human race, gets wiped into oblivion. Here in Tirisfal Glades we face a particularly annoying breed of humans: The Scarlet Crusade.Venture forth and wage an offensive on the Scarlet Crusade, <class>. Bring me back 10 Scarlet Insignia Rings as proof of your loyalty to Varimathras and The Dark Lady."
375,"It's so cold, now.  The Plague of Undeath crawls through my veins like an icy serpent.  The Mindless State will be upon me soon.  But no doomed destiny will prevent me from serving our Dark Lady.  When the call arose I sewed body bags for the fallen soldiers of Sylvanas's mighty army.Now my hands shake from the chill.  If you would bring me five Duskbat Pelts and some Coarse Thread I could sew myself a blanket.  Help me, <name>, so that I can continue to serve the cause."
376,"My duties include tending to our wounded warriors, tailoring armor and clothes, and assisting Shadow Priest Sarvis with whatever else he might need.From the look of it, you'll be enlisted in his service also... hunting the Mindless Ones, if I know his mind. Well, if you'd like to stay in one piece--and I've no doubt you do--perhaps I can help. I'm running out of paws and wings, and if you bring me some, I'll find some armor for you. You'll find a good number of wolves and bats to the south."
377,"As if the neglect for the residents of Duskwood was not bad enough, now the House of Nobles spits in the eye of the Darkshire Council with their decision to imprison Dextren Ward in Stormwind rather than behead the villain as per Lord Ebonlocke's sentence.Ward was caught selling bodies from the cemetery to Morbent Fel, a crime punishable by death.  Yet Stormwind claims Ward as their prisoner.Assassinate Ward in The Stormwind Stockade - bring me his hand - and I shall reward you."
378,"You have proven your loyalty to King Magni, <class>.  And your hatred for the Dark Iron scum is as great as my own.There is a task I wish to complete myself but I am bound by honor to stay with Longbraid.  But Roggo has gathered intelligence that proves Kam Deepfury was a conspirator in the attack on the Thandol Span.  It was by Deepfury's planning that Longbraid lost his kin.Deepfury is being held for political reasons in the Stormwind Stockade.  I want him dead, <name>.  For Longbraid!  Bring me his head!"
379,"You want a power source.  I can help you with that.  Know what I want?  I want something to drink!  Bring me five Wastewander Water Pouches, and I'll give you the 4711-FTZ.Now... guess where you can find Wastewander Water Pouches!  Why don't you walk up to one of the Wastewander nomads to the east of here and ask them for one.  Let me know how that works out for you."
380,"One of our greatest struggles is obtaining the natural resources we need to survive. Gold was scarce even in the height of the Alliance's power.There is a gold mine to the northwest that has been overrun with spiders. We need gold from the mine, but we can't very well get it while the spiders are crawling around in there. I've not much manpower to commit to the task, so we'll just have to do it little by little.Get up there and see what you can do for us, <name>."
381,"You'll be happy to know we appear to be making progress in the mine, thanks in no small part to your efforts.  We can now turn our eyes to other concerns.My scouts have reported that a detachment of the Scarlet Crusade is setting up a camp southeast of here. The Scarlet Crusade is a despicable organization that hunts us, and they will not rest until every undead--Lich King's Scourge or no--is destroyed. We must strike first!Be careful, their unholy zeal makes them dangerous adversaries."
382,"Reports from my superiors in Brill indicate that an agent of the Scarlet Crusade was dispatched from the Scarlet Monastery and sent here to Deathknell. According to the reports, the messenger possesses important information on his person. I do not have further details, but whatever it is, we must have it!You're the most qualified person I have to send, <name>. Find that messenger and bring me whatever information you can find."
383,"These will need to be taken to my superior, Executor Zygand, in Brill. With this information, we'll be able to deal a decisive blow to the Scarlet Crusade. Your services have been useful here in Deathknell, but I need someone to deliver this to Zygand, and I believe he'll be able to find you more appropriate work.Take the road north out of Deathknell. Soon after entering Tirisfal proper, you'll hit a crossroads. Take the eastern fork, and keep going east. You'll pass Cold Hearth Manor along the way."
384,"Nothing my tavern patrons enjoy more than some Beer Basted Boar Ribs!  Only problem is, the local trapper who used to bring me supplies enlisted in the King's Army to help with the war on the Alliance front.Maybe you can help me out?  If you bring me six crag boar ribs and a Rhapsody Malt from the tavern here, I'll give you the family recipe for my famous Beer Basted Boar Ribs, not to mention a free sample!  The secret's in the Malt!"
385,"Many a hunter is attracted to Loch Modan to hunt our famous crocs. There are always merchants who seek out crocolisk skins for clothing items or armor, and there are also some who enjoy the taste of their meat.We do some trade in this, but not a huge amount, as the crocolisks are ferocious and have entrenched themselves on the islands in the Loch. But don't let me dissuade you, it's quite an experience, wrestling with the jaws of the beasts.Why, this one time..."
386,"Targorr the Dread served under Gath'Ilzogg as supreme Executioner.  His methods were ruthless, even by filthy orc standards.  Men who fought bravely to defend the Kingdom were tortured on his whim.  Now he is being held in the Stormwind Stockade, sentenced to die.  Yet something is amiss.  One of the bureaucratic nobles put a hold on his execution.  I am sure foul play is in the works.Put an end to Targorr the Dread, <name>.  Travel to The Stockade and behead him before trickery is upon us."
387,The uprising must be quelled!  I need your assistance.  If word gets out that the prison is overrun I will lose my job!  This is a case of foul play if I've ever seen one.  But what's important now is forcing these prisoners into submission for the safety of Stormwind.The punishment for insurgency is death.  Kill some of these deviants!  That ought to get things under control.
388,"Bitterness flows through my veins like a cold river.  My grandson, Mac, was such a good boy.  A mere 14 years old.  When the army was sent off to the front, Mac took up arms to defend the city.  He was a guard in The Stockade, where the Defias gang is locked up.  Mac reprimanded some of the prisoners for tearing their wool blankets to make scarves, a symbol of their gang.  For that Mac was stabbed in the back.I want revenge.  Bring me 10 of their precious Wool Bandanas.  They are the color of blood."
389,"VanCleef and I were members of the Stonemasons Guild. Our main project was to rebuild Stormwind after the War.When we had finished our duties, we were cheated. The nobles refused to pay us for our work. Some of the more senior of the Stonemasons were offered governmental jobs, but VanCleef refused it out of loyalty to all the Stonemasons. He led a riot and left the city, swearing revenge.His lieutenant, Bazil Thredd, might know more about VanCleef's plans. He's being held prisoner in the Stockade."
391,"Let's get one thing straight, <name>: I don't trust you. But, with the situation as it is, you probably won't make a difference.So here's how it's going to be: go down there and have your talk with Thredd. If you're really on our side, then kill him and bring me his head when the job's done. And if it turns out you're on his side, and don't come out... when we find you, you'll die along with the rest of the maggots."
392,"During the first years of Thredd's imprisonment, he never had any visitors. I figured that he was no longer of use to the Brotherhood, so they abandoned him.Anyway, a few months ago, that all changed; he started to get regular visits... once, maybe twice a week. It was a strange man--the quiet type. I had my suspicions, but all his papers checked out.His documents claimed his name was Maelik; here's his description. I don't think he'll be coming to visit Thredd anymore."
393,"I really haven't a clue, <name>. There is someone else who might be able to help you, and it so happens that he owes me a favor for--well, let's not get into that. Master Mathias Shaw of SI:7 can be found in the barracks in Old Town. Shaw has his thumb on most of the shady, or underhanded dealings of the city.If anyone knows, it'd be him."
394,"Find Shaw in Old Town. Let him know that the Lescovar threat has been dealt with and about your involvement in the Lord's plots against the city. I'm sure he'll be proud to have another hero among Stormwind's citizens.He'll more than likely send you off to meet with the Prince or some other noble. Don't let it get to your head, <name>. The nobles can think they rule the city all they want, but some things remain out of their hands."
395,"Ah, I almost forgot. Alexston came while you were away, he wished to speak with you. No doubt he wishes to report the goings-on of the Defias Brotherhood to the nobles.A bit of advice, <name>: if anyone should ask, I would provide all details but that it was your hand that slew Lescovar. Trust me. I am... acquainted... with the ways of such things.And as far as Trias goes, well, speak to no one of him... ever... if you can help it."
396,"I have prepared a report for the King. I believe you should be the one to deliver it to him, along with an account of your findings. Do not worry, there is no doubt that he will commend you for doing your duty to the people of Stormwind.Your audience is scheduled soon, so you'd best hurry, it's a bit of a ways to Stormwind Keep."
397,"I hear Lord Wishock enjoyed his beverage.You have served us well, <name>.  The Warlocks of Stormwind will be able to practice our ways without disturbance, thanks to you.  For your efforts, I have prepared a special gift for you.  Speak with my servant, Zggi, and claim your reward."
398,"Wanted: Maggot Eye!A foul beast, even by Gnoll standards, Maggot Eye has been sentenced to death for his crimes against The Forsaken.  This despicable villain has been stealing corpses for use by the Lich King's army.  Maggot Eye was last seen pillaging the lands near Garren's Haunt to the north of Brill.The town of Brill hereby offers a reward to the capable soul who can carry out the execution.  Show Executor Zygand the villain's paw once the deed is done.Mercy is for the weak."
399,"It seems an eternity since I was a boy working the farm in Westfall. They say you can never go back, and it's true. Doubly true in my case, my family's home has been burned down and taken over by thieves.I have spoken with my father about the fate of some of my possessions, including my first compass. He was unable to save them. However, he also says that they should be hidden away on the farm.You'll find the Alexston Farmstead west of Sentinel Hill. Perhaps you could go and retrieve it for me?"
400,"Beldin Steelgrill owns the local mechanic shop, and he's the best siege engine tech there is!  But he's not forgiving to his tools.  I swear he almost breaks more arclight spanners than we can supply him with!We just filled his last order for tools.  If you deliver it to him I'm sure he'll make it worth the effort.His shop, Steelgrill's Depot, is just northeast of Kharanos.  And it's a local haunt for veteran siege engine pilots, so keep your ears open for opportunities while you're there."
401,I'm almost finished translating that note.  If you come back in a few moments I should be done.
404,"Scourge have trickled into Tirisfal Glades and have infested the area west of Brill, near the old bridge.Go there and beat back the rotting dead and ravaged corpses you find.  Scatter their bones and bring back their putrid claws, and the Deathguards will reward you."
405,"Bethor Iceshard, a high-ranking and powerful mage in the Undercity to the south, commands me to send him an agent with proven worth against the Scourge.  You, <name>, will be that agent.Present these orders to Bethor.  He will then instruct you on your mission.  I don't know its details, but it deals with recruiting a wayward Lich.  And it will be dangerous.So ready yourself, <class>.  You must not fail.You may find Bethor in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity."
407,"Harmless pumpkins, right?  Or so it would seem.  If we are to defeat Arthas's advances from the North and the Human infestation from the South we need to start realizing the full potential of our gift of undeath.With a little ingenuity a simple pumpkin becomes an agent for our Dark Lady.  This pumpkin, laced with my latest formula, will prove to be quite a treat.Yet another Scarlet Zealot has been captured and is being kept in the cellar of the Gallow's End Tavern.  Take this pumpkin to the fool."
408,"The Agamand Mills area has become a foothold for the Scourge.  Their strongest point is the Agamand Family Crypt where their local military leader, a skeleton named Captain Dargol, has headquartered.  With Necromancy he has raised the ancestors of the Agamands and plans to use them against us.This cannot pass, and you must stop it.  Travel to the Agamand Family Crypt and defeat the raised Agamand ancestors.And, bring me the skull of Captain Dargol."
409,"You say you are not bound by the will of the Lich King, and the enchantment Bethor placed upon my book corroborates this.  But before I believe you I must have proof that you are enemy to the Scourge.There is an old, bloody altar just off the southern coast of this island.  it is used by a powerful Scourge agent, Lillith Nefara.Take a Candle of Beckoning from this crate here.  Light it on the altar and Lillith will awake.  Destroy Lillith, and I will believe you are the Lich King's foe."
411,Take this Nether Gem to my old comrade Bethor.  It will let us communicate ... and I have much to tell him.
412,"Upon further analysis of the Gnomeregan situation, it would appear as though we not only failed to eradicate the troggs but we also happened to turn most of the gnomish race into horrific, mindless, evil-doing leper gnomes.Ozzie and I plan to reverse the horrible leper effect with our latest invention: The Recombobulator.  The machine is almost complete but we are in dire need of some Restabilization Cogs and Gyromechanic Gears.  Retrieve some from the leper gnomes out front of Gnomeregan for us."
413,"I'd like my brother Wellart to try my new Shimmer Stout.  He's a Mountaineer stationed in the southern guard tower, one of two towers on the border to Loch Modan.He may not be a brewer like the rest of us Barleybrews, but he loves his drinks and I know he'll like this one.Can you bring him this Barrel of Shimmer Stout for me?"
414,"I've been drinking more of that Shimmer Stout my brother made - it's great stuff!  I want a fellow Mountaineer to try it.  His name's Kadrell, and he's usually patrolling the road through Thelsamar in Loch Modan.To get to Thelsamar, go southeast through the tunnel, then turn northeast when the path forks into a road.  Follow that road straight into Thelsamar.Give Mountaineer Kadrell this cask of Shimmer Stout and see what he thinks!"
415,Rejold Barleybrew at Brewnall Village has been asking for you.He wants to talk to you about a new drink he's been brewing...said something about you helping him with it.  You might want to head back to Brewnall Village and see what he has to say.There could be some free booze in it for you...
416,"We have a real infestation problem to the west.  Tunnel rat kobolds have moved into the foothills, setting up dens and fouling our land with their filth!We want them eliminated.  Hunt them, bring me their ears and earn their bounty.You can find tunnel rat kobolds and their dens west of Thelsamar, littered along the mountainside."
417,"Hildelve wrote in his journal that he was attacked by Mangeclaw, a ""huge Ice Claw Bear.""  He drove off the beast, but not before it mauled him savagely.Judging from the state of Hildelve's body, Mangeclaw must have later returned and killed him.However, Hildelve wrote in his journal his one, final wish:Revenge against Mangeclaw."
418,"There's never a shortage of empty bellies here in Thelsamar, kids running in and out, workers from the excavation coming in after  a hard day's work. We're famous for our blood sausages, I don't suppose you've ever tried them?No? Well, around here you've got to work for your meals, and don't think just because you're a fancy <class>, you'll be any exception.I'll need bear meat, boar intestines for the casings, and spider ichor for spice. You get me some of those, and leave the cooking to Vidra!"
419,"My friend and fellow Siege Engine pilot, Mori Hildelve, is lost in the hills.  We were looking for a rare ore that's needed for a high-grade blastpowder, and during our search he drove his engine up a steep hill and busted it!Still convinced that ore was in these mountains, Hildelve charged me to guard our engines while he continued on foot, searching.It's been days, and I've heard some beastly growls in the hills at night.  Mori's tough as nails, but I'm worried.Please, <name>.  Find him."
420,"The troggs in the tunnel are extremely hostile, and haven't shown any hesitation in attacking travelers through the tunnel. You seem tough enough, though, so you should probably be safe.Directions? If you're going to speak with Senir, you'll find him in Kharanos.Make your way through the tunnel, and after you come out on the other side, just keep following the road, it'll run right into Kharanos."
421,"Lady Sylvanas has charged Varimathras with the conquering of the human and dwarven lands to the south.But that fool, Arugal -- charlatan of Dalaran and now cursed beast of Shadowfang Keep -- let his reckless magic wreak havoc with the strategic stronghold of Silverpine Forest.I need someone skilled in the ways of combat to help clean up Arugal's mess.  Prove yourself to me by killing 5 Moonrage Whitescalps.  The wretched beasts can often be found just off the road, down the hill below."
422,How Arugal gained acceptance within the Kirin Tor is beyond me.  His spell-casting knowledge seemed as transparent as a blown glass bauble.What's important now is learning exactly what magic Arugal used so that I can turn it against him and secure Silverpine Forest for the Dark Lady.Arugal first stayed at the wheat farm just north of the bridge.  One of the Deathstalkers reported seeing some spellbooks but could not secure them.  Retrieve for me the spell labeled Remedy of Arugal from those books.
423,After examining Arugal's work my worst suspicions were confirmed.  The old hack was not qualified to clean chamber pots in Dalaran let alone represent the Kirin Tor in its most dire hour.  Fools!Arugal used enchanted items to reinforce his weak magic.  I need to examine these items first hand.  Travel forth and slay Moonrage Gluttons and Moonrage Darksouls until you have collected enough of their enchanted shackles for my research.  The foul creatures have been seen to the north and east.
424,"It will indeed take me longer than I had thought to uncover the dark secrets behind the enchantments Arugal was using.But in the meantime I need you to take care of a slight problem our Darkstalkers have discovered.  It seems that Arugal let his magic spread to the Deep Elem Mine in the hills to the southeast.The mine would prove to be quite a resource for Varimathras's advance.I want you to behead the tainted foreman of the mine, Grimson the Pale.  With his death, the mine shall be ours."
425,"My brother Quinn and I were tasked to recon Silverpine Forest and report to High Executor Hadrec.  But we didn't get far -- when moving through this farm we were attacked by the ghoul Ivar the Foul.We escaped from Ivar, but he seriously mauled Quinn.  He's healing from the potion you gave him, but Ivar may return before Quinn recovers.Kill Ivar so Quinn will have time to heal.  Ivar is usually in the barn yonder, waiting for my guard to drop."
426,"The Scourge are trying to form a base at the Agamand Mills.  If they do, then they can stage further attacks within Tirisfal.The orders have been given.  The Scourge in the Mills must be destroyed.Go to the Mills.  Collect Notched Ribs from Rattlecage and Cracked Skull Soldiers, and Blackened Skulls from Darkeye Bonecasters.To get to the Mills, follow the road west.  After crossing the bridge, take the next fork north then keep going north.  When you see windmills, the battle will begin."
427,"The documents Executor Arren provided are just the break we needed in our battle with the wretched Scarlet Crusade.  We now know their exact locations throughout Tirisfal Glades.But the Deathguard has larger concerns.  The Lich King's army grows in number each night.  We need someone with ""initiative"" like yourself to drive the Scarlet Crusade to the grave.Prove to me you are capable of serving The Dark Lady by travelling west to the tower past the Solliden Farmstead and slay 10 Scarlet Warriors."
428,"A couple weeks ago two of our Deathstalkers, Rane and Quinn Yorick, were sent on a reconnaissance mission through northern Silverpine.  We have not heard from them.They may have become victim to the Scourge, though if that is true then I want it confirmed.  Find these Deathstalkers.Their first objective was to scout the farms in northern Silverpine.  You should begin your search there."
429,"My brother Quinn was badly hurt by the ghoul, Ivar the Foul, and I don't know if he will heal properly without magical aid.  Although I am not an apothecary, I do know that our apothecaries can make healing potions from the discolored hearts of worgs.Gather such hearts and take them to Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher to the south.  Then return here with the potion.You can find plenty of worgs between here and Malden's Orchard to the east."
430,"Here is the potion to aid in Quinn Yorick's recovery.Now if you will excuse me, I have very important work to continue..."
432,"Those Light-blasted troggs, turning my work site into a wreck! Look at that, there goes another barrel of powder!Ohhh, I wish I could go down there and wring every one of their scrawny little necks! I want to kill them all!This can't be good for my health, all this stress and anger... What have they left me with? Nothing!I'd kill them myself, but my aim's no good anymore! You go into the quarry and kill some of the filthy buggers! I'll pay you! Just hurt them, kill them!"
433,"As a member of the Senate and the Explorers' League, I've taken it upon myself to take care of this part of the trogg infestation that has gripped our lands.They've certainly made a mess of Gol'Bolar quarry, and for no reason. As we dug deep into the earth, they poured out, destroying our equipment and driving the miners out. There's not much for us to do but to exterminate the lot of them, rebuild, then get back to work.If you help me with the troggs, I'll gladly recompense you for your time."
434,"After I put on Spybot's disguise, he'll head in to talk to Lescovar. The guards should let him pass no problem.While you were getting materials for me, I took care of informing Marzon that it was time for him and Lescovar to meet again. I even dropped some false information.Lescovar will dismiss his guards and wait for Marzon out here in the garden. After you catch wind of talk about the Defias, make your move. You need to kill them both before the guards return! When you're done, speak to Trias."
435,"The wolves outside won't leave, and they eye me evilly every time I step foot out that door.  They must be incredibly hungry to think I'm worth eating.I have to report to my teammate, the Deathstalker Rane Yorick.  And to get to Rane, I'll need help against those wolves.Please escort me!  And there are a lot of wolves out there, so we'll have a better chance if you have friends who can help..."
436,"Prospector Ironband is heading an excavation of ancient ruins east of the lake.  His progress has been slow lately, especially considering all the supplies we've sent him.Ironband's a stout, honest dwarf who values results, which has me worried that forces are at work against him.Go to Ironband's Excavation and speak with Magmar Fellhew.  He manages the details of the site and will know why there's a slowdown.To get to the excavation site, go around the southern tip of the lake, then head east."
437,"Our initial scouting reports of Silverpine show the rot hides have a base at an old farm to the north, the Dead Fields.  We have sent small assaults against them, but each time they are reinforced by the banshee Nightlash, who uses her magic to rout our forces.We want Nightlash destroyed.Go to the Dead Fields and assault the rot hides.  If you don't see Nightlash then kill the rot hides until she appears, then defeat her.Her essence will turn to dust.  Bring me that dust as proof."
438,"<name>, we've discovered a new hive for the Scourge: the Decrepit Ferry.  The ferry lies east of the Sepulcher, and is heavily patrolled by rot hides and other undead.There must be a reason for the Scourge's occupation of the area.  Go to the Decrepit Ferry and find out why the Scourge are there."
439,"Among the corpses a hand protrudes, unwrapped.  It is the hand of a woman, pockmarked from the plague but relatively fresh.On the hand is a ring.  Removing the ring and inspecting it reveals an engraving:""For Deliah"""
440,"If you want to find the husband or beloved who gave Deliah her ring... then speak with Magistrate Sevren in Brill.  He should have records of recent deaths and, with luck, can discover who Deliah is.But I wouldn't hope.  Whoever gave her the ring is probably dead.  Or if he's undead he probably no longer cares about Deliah."
441,"Deliah had a husband, Raleigh, who now dwells in the Undercity.  If the Deliah who lived in Brill is the one who owned this ring, then Raleigh will know.Raleigh is in the Trade Quarter of the Undercity."
442,"Now is the time to assault the Scourge's place of strength in Silverpine: Fenris Isle.You must again go to the Isle and destroy Thule Ravenclaw.  I want his head!This mission is as dangerous as it is vital, <name>.  You must not fail."
443,"Before we launch an assault on Fenris Isle, we must determine who is behind the rot hide gnolls.  Our apothecaries believe their origin lies within the strange fluid that flows through their bodies.Go to Fenris Isle, east of the Decrepit Ferry, and collect rot hide ichor from the gnolls you find there.  Bring it to Apothecary Renferrel, stationed outside the Sepulcher."
444,"I have reduced the ichor you brought me and separated it into its base components.  My findings are not conclusive, but I have determined that warlock and necromantic magics were used in the ichor's creation.While I continue to study the ichor, I want you to take a sample to Bethor Iceshard in the Undercity.  Bethor is not an apothecary, but his knowledge of magic may help to unravel the mystery of the rot hides.Go.  You will find Bethor in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity."
445,Time is a luxury that is not afforded to those of us under the employ of Lady Sylvanas.  Surely you know this by now.As a member of the Royal Apothecary Society it is my duty to share my knowledge with my colleagues so that our collective efforts might one day provide The Dark Lady with the New Plague she so badly desires.Take these findings to Apothecary Renferrel who is stationed at The Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest.  Follow the roads to the south from Brill.  From the Undercity go southwest.
446,"This Ichor was crafted by an old colleague of mine: Thule Ravenclaw.  He was a young, promising mage before the great war, but when the Lich King rose to power, he betrayed his brethren and allied with the Scourge.I did not realize he still lives, nor that he leads the Rot Hides in their forays against us!I know many of his spells, and can help concoct a potion to counter them.  Take this scroll back to Apothecary Renferrel.  It has the incantations needed for the potion."
447,Arthas's numbers are overwhelming. But with a New Plague we could eradicate both the Scourge Army and the Human infestation once and for all.My studies have proven that spider blood combined with a toxin derived from a grizzled bear heart results in a deadly elixir. Collect samples from the spiders in the Skittering Dark to the northwest and from the bears wandering throughout Silverpine Forest. Deliver the reagents to Master Apothecary Faranell of the Royal Apothecary Society in the Undercity.
448,"Before you launch an assault on Fenris Isle, report to High Executor Hadrec.  He may have additional information or equipment you'll need."
449,"Although Quinn's wounds are mending, I want to get our report to High Executor Hadrec as quickly as possible.  It has information that is vital to the Forsaken's occupation of Silverpine."
450,"You can be of further service to the Royal Apothecary Society, <name>.When Arugal cast his wretched magic on the forest, he cursed one of our most promising members, Apothecary Berard.  Now a mindless servant of Arugal, Berard is useless to us.  But his findings might prove to be of worth.  He was studying an ancient plague that killed off all the aquatic life in Lake Lordamere ages ago.Retrieve Berard's Journal from his study in the Pyrewood Village Inn and take it to Apothecary Renferrel."
451,According to Berard's Journal the moss from Lake Skulkers and Creepers might prove useful for our quest to brew a new plague.  Those beasts dwell on the islands in Lake Lordamere to the east.He also mentions a very rare Hardened Tumor that he discovered on a Vile Fin murloc.  Apparently the tumor is so rare Berard was only able to obtain one.Collect samples of the moss as well as the rare hardened tumor and take them to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity.
452,"You got here just in the nick of time, <name>!The Pyrewood Council will be returning any moment.  Arugal has other matters to tend to in the keep.  He uses the Council as mere puppets to keep the mindless minions of Pyrewood under his control.  But I believe that without the guidance of the Pyrewood Council, the sons of Arugal will turn against their master.I cannot handle them all by myself.  I need you to help me.  Together we can lay waste to the Council for Lady Sylvanas."
453,"Good luck, <name>.  I hope you find the chap, and I hope you find him alive.If he's left the safety of Darkshire then he could be prey to the beasts of the wilds."
454,"We'd been hauling the barrels of powder back and forth in trips before this... business. Now we have to split up the work, Miran's taking the barrels and I'm watching over the other ones.I don't feel safe letting Miran haul the rest of the shipment by himself. When he's ready to go, maybe you could escort him on his next trip?"
455,"Orcs of the Dragonmaw clan have a haven in the Wetlands.  And now they have expanded into Dun Algaz!  We can't let them keep their foothold here or Loch Modan will be cut off from Menethil Harbor, our port and stronghold in the Wetlands.Break through Dun Algaz to the Wetlands beyond, and kill some orcs for good measure!  Report to Valstag Ironjaw in Menethil Harbor.Menethil is through Dun Algaz, then north along the road, then west at the fork.We're counting on you, <name>.  Do not fail."
456,"Greetings, <name>.  I am Conservator Ilthalaine.  My purpose in Shadowglen is to ensure that the balance of nature is maintained.The spring rains were particularly heavy this year, causing some of the forest's beasts to flourish while others suffered.Unfortunately, the nightsaber and thistle boar populations grew too large.  Shadowglen can only produce so much food for the beasts.  Journey forth, young <class>, and thin the boar and saber populations so that nature's harmony will be preserved."
457,"Thinning the younger population of creatures here in Shadowglen was a good start, <name>, but there is still work to be done.The resources of the forest will be depleted too quickly if the problem is not addressed.  Killing nature's beasts is a necessary evil for the good of all who share the land.  Venture into the forest and slay mangy nightsabers and thistle boars in the name of balance."
458,"Thank goodness you are here, <class>. Strange news has traveled to me through the whisperings of the forest spirits.The mysterious woodland protector, Tarindrella, has returned to Shadowglen. The dryad's presence has not been felt in the forests of Kalimdor in years. Something is surely amiss if she has journeyed back to this land.Seek out Tarindrella and see what business she tends to in our grove. One of the Sentinels reported seeing her to the southwest of Aldrassil."
459,"Something evil is brewing in the forests of Teldrassil.  Look long the hills to where the peaceful furbolgs used to dwell.  They have deserted their homes and are amassing under the name of the Gnarlpine tribe.Only the corruption of wicked Fel Moss could cause such a transformation.  The grells and grellkin have infested the area and are threatening the residents of Shadowglen.Engage these grells and grellkin, <name>, and see if they are indeed caught under the enchantment of the wicked Fel Moss."
460,"You don't look like a rot hide.  Good.  I had lost hope...My name is Alaric, and I was once Thule's head servant and bodyguard.  He used his magic to ""protect"" me from the Plague of Undeath, but instead his spell gave me an unlife from which I cannot escape.  And after creating the cursed rot hide gnolls, Thule beheaded me... and gave my head to the gnolls as a plaything!Please, take me to my body.  I believe the gnolls buried it here in Fenris Keep, near the stable, in an unmarked grave."
461,"I know of a hidden niche within the keep that holds an item dear to Thule, and his old colleagues.  It also holds something you might find useful.  Take me there!The alcove is in the southwestern tower of the keep, behind a dusty shelf.Take my body, but leave my boots.  They never fit me anyway..."
463,"You've heard of the Greenwarden?  You're not looking for him, are you?  Well I say you're crazy if you are, but who am I to keep a fool from <his/her> death?If you are seeking that beast, then I hear he is in the marsh, east of the road where it forks to Dun Modr.  He's lurking there among the crocs...and worse!And leave your money here.  You won't need it where you're going...and you don't want to chip ol' Greenie's tooth on your gold when he bites you in half, do you?"
464,"The Dragonmaw orc clan was all but destroyed by the end of the Second War, after they lost control of their red dragon pets.  The dragons were not very happy with their old masters, and fiercely hunted the Dragonmaws.  What few remained fled from Grim Batol and into the Mountains east of Whelgar's Excavation.Now they've gained strength, and have an encampment northeast of Menethil.We want you to attack that encampment.  Gather and bring me their war banners as proof."
465,"While you were fighting the Dragonmaws, we discovered more of their plans.Nek'rosh has built catapults and aims to lay siege to Menethil!  And with the fighting in Dun Algaz, we're effectively blocked from reinforcements!You need to take out those catapults.  They're in the Dragonmaw encampment.Here, take this tinder.  Fight your way to the catapults and light them with the tinder.And after you've done that, find and kill Nek'rosh.  We need to cut this Dragonmaw beast down...at its neck."
466,"I heard that a rare ore, incendicite, was found in the Wetlands, in a cave northwest of Algaz Gate.  Incendicite is volatile stuff and hard to use without blowing yourself up, but I'm sure if it's smelted the right way it could make cannon shells that pack a mighty punch!Get me incendicite ore and I'll find someone brave enough to experiment with it.Oh, and to extract that ore from a vein you'll need skill in mining.  If you don't have it, then ... bring a friend who does to that cave!"
467,"Pilot Stonegear loves his siege engine, as every pilot should!  And he's always eager to find new ways to improve his tank's firepower!He heard rumors of a rare ore and is looking for someone to hunt it down for him.  If your boots are starting to itch, then find Stonegear at Steelgrill's Depot in Dun Morogh and see what he wants."
468,"Mountaineer Rockgar is looking for volunteers for a mission through Dun Algaz and into the Wetlands.If you want to get your boots wet in that soggy county to the north, then speak with Rockgar at Dun Algaz.  Dun Algaz is north up the road, beyond the guard tower."
469,"Greetings, traveler!Don't suppose you might be heading in the direction of Menethil, would you? If you're not, I'd suggest you stop there, it's a good place to purchase goods and even have a pint and relax.Now, if it just so happens that you're heading in that direction, I don't suppose you'd mind taking this bundle of crocolisk skins to James Halloran, the tanner?I'd do it myself, but my wife's been in quite a mood lately, and I'd like to put off facing her as long as possible."
470,"On my weekly visit to Ironbeard's Tomb I was attacked by dreadful, dripping oozes! Naturally, I panicked.I threw my bag at one, but it didn't do anything! The ooze just sucked it right up... Luckily, it did give me enough time to get away.The bad news is that I really need to get the contents of my bag!I don't know which ooze I threw my bag at; they all looked the same! Ironbeard's Tomb is northeast of here, near Dun Modr. Thank you so much!"
471,"I sent my apprentice out into the marshes to skin some of our famous giant Wetlands crocolisks. When he didn't return, I went out to look for him... Let's just say it wasn't a pretty sight.Midwife says he might pull through, but in the meantime I still need my skins!...If you'd like to kill a few more of the brutes, I wouldn't be opposed, after what they did. You'll find the crocs north up the coast, beyond the murloc hovels."
472,"Dun Modr has fallen to the Dark Iron Dwarves!My wounds are grave, <class>.  Most of the regiment was killed!  The Dark Iron thugs attacked us before we could regroup from the Thandol Span ambush.Our leader, Longbraid, sounded the retreat horn.  As we left the town I was hit by a stray axe in the back.  All went black.I awoke here in Menethil but I fear for my fellow soldiers.  Hope still burns within me.  Perhaps Longbraid is still alive!  See if you can find him near Dun Modr, <race>!"
473,"<name>.  The Dragonmaw orc clan is showing its strength in more than just Algaz.  Captain Stoutfist has asked to speak with those willing to offer aid against these orcs.  He is inside the keep, in the war room."
474,"Now that the catapults have been burned, find and kill Chieftain Nek'rosh."
475,"A troubling breeze blows through the forest.Gaerolas Talvethren serves as Great Warden to the hibernating Druids of the Talon in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den.  His duty as the chosen protector of the Sleeping is to ensure their safety so that their pact with Ysera remains fulfilled.But word from Gaerolas is now delayed and I grow nervous.  Travel east to Starbreeze Village and bring back a report from Gaerolas so that I can put my worries to rest, knowing my dreaming brethren slumber safely."
476,"The Gnarlpine tribe has been corrupted!The once peaceful furbolgs have turned against the protectors of the forest.  They ambushed me as I left for the Ban'ethil Barrow Den and proceeded to pillage Starbreeze Village.  Ursal the Mauler, their chieftain, is using the evil powers of the Fel Moss to drive them mad.I am too wounded to return to Athridas to bring him this grave news.  The task is left to you, young <class>.  We can only hope that the deranged Gnarlpines have not made it to Ban'ethil yet!"
477,"As you may know, the town of Ambermill remains a source of human opposition, mainly through the support they receive from the wizards of Dalaran.I don't know what their plan is, but for them to show interest in a backwater village like Ambermill indicates that it must have some greater importance.They've been shipping crates by the wagon from Hillsbrad. Many of those supplies end up at a small camp north of Pyrewood Village. Retrieve the contents of a crate and return them to me."
478,<You quickly remove the pendant from the crate and replace the lid.>
479,"Dalar is attempting to locate the source of the wizards' spellcasting. For now, we'll have to slow their progress in any way we can...The conjurers, mages and protectors are no doubt carrying the pendants. Remove and retrieve them.Take the main road south and the eastern fork into Ambermill."
480,"An archmage of great power is overseeing the reactivation of the ley energy node. With the progress they have made, our only hope of stopping them is by killing him. It will be difficult, he is no doubt protected by many other mages and warders.You must go, and you must dispatch him quickly. When he is dead, retrieve his staff for me. Go now."
481,"Take the pendant to Dalar Dawnweaver, perhaps he can shed some light on the wizards' plans."
482,"Of course! How could I have forgotten?Ambermill was one of the sites earmarked by the Kirin Tor, noted because it houses a dormant ley energy node. The wizards must be planning to reactivate the node and use its energies for some greater purpose.We cannot allow this to happen...It will take a great amount of power to activate the area's ley energies, we can stall them by taking the pendants away from the wizards.Relay this information to Allister, he will decide a course of action."
483,"Gnarlpine invaders were seen ravaging the Ban'ethil Barrow Den to the west.The slumbering druids will be trapped in the Emerald Dream for eternity, unaware of their fate, unless we help. The delicate hibernation ritual cannot be broken without the Relics of Wakening.Journey to the Den and retrieve the Raven Claw Talisman, Black Feather Quill, Sapphire of Sky, and Rune of Nesting. The druids store them in sacred chests.  Return them to me and I will prepare the awakening ritual."
484,"I'm James Halloran, the tanner. My cured crocolisk skins are sought after all over, shipments leaving by boat to ports around the world.Met Einar? He's one of the hunters that brings crocolisk skins in for me.I'm a bit short on the softer skins that come off crocolisk young.Being that I'm running low, I'll pay you top coin for a stack of the skins. You can find the young crocs in the marshes right outside of town."
485,"You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.""My name's Oglethorpe Obnoticus, and my homing robot has crashed!  I will reward you for its recovery; please take this beacon to the robot!""""I now have computed the coordinates of the robot for you; it crashed at the head of the river near Skulk Rock!"""
486,"Now the time has come to save the Druids of the Talon. If we fail now, <name>, they will be forever lost in sleep.I shall prepare the Relics of Wakening and perform the ritual. For my work to take effect, the cursed beast responsible for this horrible situation must be slain.  Only then will the ritual be complete.It was Ursal the Mauler who meddled with our brethren's calling and it is Ursal the Mauler who must now pay so they can be freed.  Travel to Gnarlpine Hold in the southwest and slay him."
487,"The road to Darnassus must be kept safe.  Travelers heading from Dolanaar to Darnassus have been reporting ruthless attacks by corrupted furbolgs from the Gnarlpine tribe.Important news and commerce travels to and from Darnassus by way of this road daily.  We cannot afford to have a rogue band of heathens terrorizing people.Take up arms in the name of the sacred forest, <class>.  Their den lies somewhere below this vantage point.  Slay 6 of these Gnarlpine ambushers and report back to me."
488,"Eager for work, I see.  Lucky for you a day never goes by that I don't wish I had a fledgling <class> to perform my bidding.You see, <name>, I can make you very happy and provide you with things you never dreamed of having.  But in order for that to happen you must bring me certain items.My business in the forest often requires certain. . .reagents.  Fetch for me 3 Nightsaber Fangs, 3 Strigid Owl Feathers and 3 swatches of Webwood Spider Silk.Let's keep this our little secret, <race>."
489,"The Council of the Forest has news that you aided Zenn Foulhoof. The satyr is an enemy of the forest. As a <race>, you should know better than to defile the forest by killing Nature's creatures.You must redeem yourself in the eyes of the Council if you wish to remain a friend of Teldrassil.Teach Foulhoof a lesson and you shall be redeemed. Fel Cones are corrupted seeds that fall from the trees. They billow with green smoke.Give some to Foulhoof. He'll think you have brought him a harmless snack."
491,"Thule once told me that, long ago, he and two colleagues created a magic wand, woven together from the apprentice wands each mage possessed.  This wand was a symbol of their friendship, and although Thule came to despise it he could not part with it, nor could he let the others have it.  So he stole the wand, and hid it in Fenris Keep.Here.  Take the wand to Bethor Iceshard, one of Thule's friends from years past.  I'm sure he will want it."
492,"According to the Deathguard, another one of those foolish Dwarven Mountaineers has just been captured.  The Deathguard likes to use the cellar of the Gallows End Tavern as a holding cell until prisoners can be ""properly"" dealt with.Why don't you go see how the Captured Mountaineer enjoys this special drink I made for him?  It contains a subtle hint of what The Dark Lady has planned for the rest of Azeroth."
493,"The Royal Apothecary Society is under extreme pressure from the Dark Lady to develop a New Plague.  We are working diligently and have made much progress.  It is our belief that the success will be achieved much faster if we share information amongst the Society.For that reason I want you to deliver my latest findings to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill, a small town nestled in the Hillsbrad Foothills.  The journey will be a long one.Head south and stick to the roads.  Follow the signs closely!"
494,"Be silent and pay attention, <class>.I was sent to this position in order to survey the town of Hillsbrad.  My mission is one of reconnaissance.  It is imperative that you send word to High Executor Darthalia in Tarren Mill at once.  Let her know that I, Deathstalker Lesh, send the following message:""The raven's cry from the west doth beckon.""Follow the road to the east and pay close attention to the signs.  Now, hurry!  Off you go to Tarren Mill, and with urgency I might add!"
495,"Mug'Thol and his ogre warband was sent to Alterac to retrieve the Crown of Will for Lady Sylvanas. Unfortunately, instead of returning it, the idiot decided to try it on... I suppose ogres can't resist anything bright and shiny.His bumbling actions have become something of a problem, however. The Crown of Will enabled him to resist the possession placed upon him to serve Lady Sylvanas.The Dark Lady wants an example made, travel to Tarren Mill in Hillsbrad and report to Melisara, my lieutenant."
496,"Ah, another wretched day in Tarren Mill.  All of this clean air puts me in such a foul mood, <name>.The sooner we can plague the humans here, the better.  I've been conducting intense studies on possible killing agents to use in my concoctions but I haven't the time to collect them all.If you want to make yourself of use, procure the following items for me:  10 Gray Bear Tongues and the very rare and hard to find, Creeper Ichor.  You'll find both bears and creepers just outside of Tarren Mill."
498,"Me and some other warriors were sent by the Warchief to retrieve an object from Durnholde and to investigate this so-called Syndicate.We went to Durnholde to take a look around, but we were taken by surprise by a large number of the humans. We fought bravely, but their sheer numbers were enough to defeat us. They took a few of us captive, but I was able to escape.Durnholde is just southeast of here, across the river. Drull and Tog'thar are being held there, you must go and rescue them."
499,"It will take but a moment for me to mix these components into what I have deemed an Elixir of Suffering.There we go!  Ah, nothing brightens a gloomy day in these miserable foothills like bringing a little suffering into the world.Let us see if our little potion has achieved its desired effect.Give my assistant Umpi a taste of what the Dark Lady has planned for both humans and Scourge alike."
500,"Crushridge ogres have dug an ogre mound up in the Alterac Mountains near the ruined city of Alterac.  And my scouts tell me they've taken over those ruins as well.We can't let them get cozy up there; if they think they're safe where they are, then their next step will be to move down into the foothills, which will put them right at our front door!Go north to the Alterac Mountains and hunt ogres.  Bring me the Dirty Knucklebones they carry and you will earn a nice bounty."
501,"Oh, <name>. . .the flowers are blooming in Hillsbrad and the air is so fresh and brisk.  I can't help but to wallow in the misery of it all.  I look out my grimy window and long for the day when our New Plague brings this world the death it deserves.As much as I would love to sit and brood all day, my duty to the Dark Lady calls.  Help me, would you?  My research leads me to believe I can make the most splendid death-brew with the blood of a Mountain Lion.  Bring some to me and we'll have a little fun."
502,"Ah, nothing like the smell of fresh blood in the foothills!Now we'll mix in a touch of this and a little of that and let the real fun begin!  What I have created with this blood, I like to call an Elixir of Pain.  If my calculations are correct this concoction could be the start of something very beautiful for Lady Sylvanas.  But what we need is a test.Take this elixir out to the northern farm in Hillsbrad Fields to the southwest.  Let's see how Farmer Ray's little dog Stanley likes this ""treat."""
503,"From what I can tell of the documents you procured, Gol'dir is being held in a large Syndicate base to the north, most likely in the Alterac Mountains. He has been held captive far too long and must be freed."
504,"Now that you've had a taste of the Crushridge ogres, I want you to really bloody their noses...Go into the Ruins of Alterac and seek out the Crushridge Warmongers.  I want you to cut down a good number of them - that's the only way those brutes will learn to keep their distance from Alliance territory."
505,"I am the new magistrate of Southshore, recently assigned after the assassination of the previous magistrate.  The assassins were never found, but through our investigations we're almost certain they were hired by the Syndicate - a group of thieves led by villainous nobles of the now fallen kingdom of Alterac.The Syndicate has a camps in Sofera's Naze and Corahn's Dagger, north and west of the Horde-occupied Tarren Mill.  Slay the Syndicate members you find in these camps."
506,"A day or two ago, I was visited by the leader of this Syndicate. His name was Aliden Perenolde, and styled himself lord of this land. He confided in me his plans to take the orcs that stood against him as slaves, just as his father and his mentor, the despised Blackmoore, had planned.More important was that he brought his mistress, a wisp of a girl named Elysa. Around her neck was the pendant the Warchief desires.Now go, I will make my own way, after I have settled my business here."
507,"It is clear that Perenolde must be killed, his foulness removed from the world. His manor lies a ways to the north of here, on the shores of Lordamere Lake. Do your duty, <name>, then retrieve the pendant that the Warchief desires, and return here."
508,"The pendant? Of course you can have it... Take it! I want no memory of him... just please, please leave in peace..."
509,"Another day, another elixir to be made. If it were up to me, I'd just let the pathetic humans and Scourge fight it out.  They seem bent on killing each other as is.Alas, our Dark Lady wants to help speed up the process a tad so why not pass these morbid days by spreading a little death and disease across the land?Here's the plan, <name>: you go out to Nethander Stead, south of Tarren Mill and east of the river and Southshore. Collect for me 6 Mudsnout Blossoms from the field for my next elixir."
510,"Among these documents is a list of requested supplies.  These include mundane items (food, weapons, clothing) as well as more exotic gear (masks, oil, poison)."
511,One of the letters on this table is encrypted and inscrutable.
512,"I fear the leadership behind the Syndicate is bent on Southshore's ruin.  We must strike hard at these leaders before their plans are realized.Enter the ruins of Strahnbrad, in the Alterac Mountains to the north.  We think the Syndicate is using the area as a headquarters.We know this gang of cutthroats is run by former Alterac nobles.  They may be hiding as normal Syndicate agents, but you'll know you've killed a noble by the signet ring he wears.Bring me those signet rings."
513,"Just when I thought another day was going to pass devoid of any joy, you brought me those marvelous Mudsnout Blossoms.First I will mix them down into a fine composite.  We'll then need Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity to apply his colloid of decay to it and then we'll be ready for some good fun indeed!Here, take this Mudsnout Composite and run it off to Master Faranell at once, <name>."
514,"I have a colleague in Ironforge who may be able to help decrypt this letter.  Go to the Library in the Hall of Explorers in Ironforge and speak with Prospector Stormpike.  Tell him I sent you and show him the letter.  If there's anyone north of Blackrock Spire who can read this, it is he."
515,"A mudsnout composite?  Absolutely brilliant!  Why didn't I think of that?Let me contribute my colloid of decay to this devilish brew.In order to activate the contaminating agents in this mudsnout mixture, Lydon is going to need a strong troll's blood potion, as well as some daggerspine scales and torn fin eyes from the southern coast of Hillsbrad.  He'll know what to do once you've gathered him all the reagents.  And my, how anxious I am to hear how his experiment goes!"
516,"I have received reports that a group of undead are holing up to prepare for an attack against us. Armed with this information, we can turn the tables and attack them first, nipping their little plan in the bud.Unfortunately, my information is spotty, at best. They are reported to be hiding in a location known as Beren's Peril. The exact location is unknown, but it appears to be a cave in the hills, near a pocket of Dalaran wizards.I trust your resourcefulness. Find them, and put them down."
517,"This new elixir is finally ready to be tested.  But why let a perfectly good, highly contagious plague go to waste on a mere frog or dog?  Let's have us some true fun in the name of Lady Sylvanas.Head down to Dun Garok.  You know the barracks where those filthy little dwarves skitter about.  Steal me a keg of their Shindigger Stout.  Once I have that keg, you and I will have quite the party, <name>."
518,"Mug'Thol and his Crushridge ogres have overrun the ruins of Alterac. It will be hard to inflict any serious punishment upon him without thinning out the ogres' numbers.After softening them up, we'll proceed.Understood? Good. Now go."
519,"Targ, Muckrake, and Glommus are Mug'Thol's lieutenants. They are loyal to him, though who can say what drives an ogre to loyalty.Bring me their heads, <name>, and then all that will remain is to remove Mug'Thol's head, crown and all."
520,"With Mug'Thol's lieutenants dead, all that remains is to kill Mug'Thol and retrieve the Crown of Will. I have no doubt he'll be reluctant to part with it. Most likely expecting you, too, given the... departure... of his fellows.Find Mug'Thol, and deliver his head and the Crown to me. The Crushridge resistance will be at an end."
521,"All that remains is to deliver the Crown of Will to Sharlindra in the Undercity. She will see that it is delivered to Lady Sylvanas. I would warn you against thinking to use it for your own purposes, <name>, Mug'Thol's fate should be illustration enough."
522,"This is a contract for the assassination of Magistrate Henry Maleb.  It was sealed and stamped in red wax, using a distinctive signet ring."
523,"The contract you recovered was signed by Baron Vardus, a noble of the former kingdom of Alterac, and one known for a cold heart and brutal practices.  I'm not surprised someone like the Baron was behind this.Find this man.  Find him, and bring him to justice.  He must be among the Syndicate haunts - perhaps at the ruins of Strahnbrad, or perhaps within the valley north of them."
524,"Next door the Deathguards are holding a few captured farmers hostage.  High Executor Darthalia suspected one of the military strategists from Stormwind to be hiding out amongst them.  Apparently the military chap was found dead in the Plaguelands last night.  Darthalia, always looking out for me, decided the prisoners would be left to my disposal.I think it's time we threw those farmers a party.  Sounds like a grand ol' time!Place this tainted keg on the rug in their room.  Plagued brew for all!"
525,"I decrypted the letter, but I don't know what to make of it.  You found this among thieves in the Alterac foothills?  Very strange...You should take this to the magistrate of Southshore.  Although this letter is cryptic, his is the closest town to Alterac; if a threat is brewing, then he should know."
526,"You might have found one lightforge ingot in that chest, but that's not enough to craft anything decent!You should go back there and look for more.  Maybe the murlocs around that wrecked ship have lightforge ingots on them."
527,"Stand at attention while addressing me, <class>.I am under direct command of Varimathras.  We are to quell the human infestation until our apothecaries can develop the new plague.Our information leads us to believe that the town of Hillsbrad is vulnerable to attack.  Your first assignment is aimed at disrupting their food supply and infrastructure.Travel west.  Raid the northernmost farms of Hillsbrad Fields.  Make sure that the landowners, Farmer Ray and Farmer Getz, are executed as well."
528,"Word of the attack on the northern farms has the townsfolk panicked.  Most excellent.Our Deathstalkers report peasants fleeing to the fields in southern Hillsbrad.  The fools think they can hide in the orchards and escape their doom.Prove them wrong, <name>.  Return to Hillsbrad Fields and seek out the cowering peasants.  Lay waste to them in the name of our Dark Lady.Dismissed!"
529,"The humans of Hillsbrad have been putting up unexpected resistance.  The problem appears to be that the townsfolk are being armed by the local blacksmith.  We need to shut down all supply lines.Your mission will be to execute Blacksmith Verringtan.  Slay his apprentices as well.  While there, bring back a shipment of iron from their stockpile.  The supplies will come in handy when we are done with the conquering of Hillsbrad and begin razing Southshore."
530,"Valdred, once my good friend, was my wife's murderer.  Although I am incapable of grieving, I do yearn for revenge.  If you kill Valdred and bring me his cursed hands, then I will reward you.I last heard he was at the Greymane Wall in southern Silverpine, trying to flee into the kingdom of Gilneas."
531,"Light! Don't bring things like that into the Lodge... it's unsanitary, unspeakable, un... un... unsanitary!Just get it out of here, will you? No one wants to see your bloody little trophy, really!"
532,"The town of Hillsbrad is in disarray and we believe it will soon fall.  We must, however, persist in our ruthlessness until the human scum are wiped from the foothills for eternity.Despite their overwhelming losses, the humans rally around their leadership and keep fighting.  We must eliminate their leader, Magistrate Burnside, as well as the town council.  Destroy their revered political document as well, the Hillsbrad Proclamation.  And while you're at it, steal the town registry."
533,"At last we begin to hear word and rumor, find evidence of Gol'dir's whereabouts. The humans have been moving him around, but we are narrowing down our search and focusing on the large Syndicate camp just north of here.Go there, <name>, and bring back whatever information you can get your hands on."
535,"Urrgh... Injured and dying and confronted with the enemy.No doubt you'll kill me anyway, but if you bring me some Southshore stout--your kind does drink, don't they?--I'll tell you what you want to know."
536,"Transferred from the Stormwind city guard to Southshore, a town that should be abandoned by the looks of it... Smell of the harbor day and night.Not to mention ol' Redpath... Wants me to take care of the murlocs. Ha!I can barely rouse myself to go out to some of the pockets of the overgrown fish down the Western Strand. If you would go in my place and take care of them, I'd appreciate it."
537,"The letter you brought me was written by a being who calls himself Nagaz, a member of the Argus Wake.  I don't know what this Argus Wake is, but if they're in alliance with the Syndicate then they must be a threat.I want you to find Nagaz and the Argus Shadow Mages mentioned in that letter.  I want you to find them, and kill them.Search in the Uplands, where the Syndicate is strongest.  It is north of Strahnbrad.With luck, you'll find these envoys of the Argus Wake there."
538,"<name>.  If you don't mind a long journey then I have a task for you, to again help Stormwind fill its library.The old kingdom of Alterac fell after the great war, and it had a large collection of books.  It's a tragedy that the city is ruined, but even more tragic is all of their knowledge lost!  We must recover what we can.Southshore is the closest town to the Ruins of Alterac.  Go there and speak with Loremaster Dibbs.  He can direct you to the ruins, and to what books may be found there."
539,"The Hillsbrad Town Registry indicates that the Azureload Mine is under Alliance control.  Furthermore, the mine is a prime source of iron ore for the Alliance armories.Even though we've struck a decisive blow to the town of Hillsbrad, the Alliance still supports and protects the Azureload Mine fervently.The mine lies due south of Hillsbrad.  Go there and slay the foreman, a human by the name of Bonds.  Kill his miners as well.  That should send a clear message to the Alliance."
540,"Those beastly ogres now reside within Alterac's ruins, and I shudder to think what they're doing with the precious books still there.  You must recover what you can!Enter the Ruins of Alterac and search for tomes looted by the ogres.  Get whatever you can find and bring them to me, but also seek out one book in particular: The Arm of Gri'lek.  It contains ancient troll lore that I must learn, and the Ruins of Alterac was the last known location of an intact copy of this book."
541,"Dwarves aiding the humans?  Damn those filthy little beasts.We shall test the strength of the so-called Alliance.  We'll see how anxious those little ankle-bashers are to help the humans once they feel our wrath.  We know exactly where their stronghold is in this territory.They have established a barracks in southeastern Hillsbrad along Thoradin's Wall called Dun Garok.  The final mission of this battle is to lay siege on Dun Garok, <class>.  Captain Ironhill, their leader, must die."
542,"I need to spend some time studying the Arm of Gri'lek book you brought me, though I'm sure Milton is eager to get the other recovered books into Stormwind's collection.Here are the books you gathered from the Ruins of Alterac, packed and catalogued.  Take them back to Milton Sheaf in Stormwind and I'm sure he'll be grateful."
543,"The Perenolde Tiara is an old heirloom of the Perenolde ""nobles"" - the ruling family of Alterac before that kingdom fell to ruin.  It is said to have been crafted by master jewelers in Ironforge, and fitted with the finest of emeralds.When Alterac was destroyed the Tiara was lost, but there are rumors that an Ogre Mage, Grel'borg the Miser, found the tiara and now wanders the Ruins of Alterac searching for more treasures.We would have you acquire the tiara for us."
544,"I came to Tarren Mill to research, but now must resolve a crisis.  You see, four Forsaken fled the Undercity a few months ago.  They turned their backs on their brethren, but what's worse...they stole from the Dark Lady.These thieves broke into a secure vault and stole four artifacts, items our apothecaries required in certain studies.  Sylvanas would have these artifacts returned.The thieves fled the Undercity to Dalaran, and those wizards quarantined them in the Lordamere Internment Camp."
545,"The wizards of Dalaran constructed a vast, magical dome around the heart of their city.  Some believe it was for protection from the violence of these times, while others say they merely wanted solitude, to study and plot.I don't care what the reason was.  I do care that the ruined outskirts of their city, outside the dome, may hide valuable magical treasures.But the area is patrolled by the wizards and their elemental slaves.So hunt them, and return when their numbers are sufficiently reduced."
546,"I hear you were enlisted by Darthalia to wage war on the humans of Hillsbrad.  So jealous I am. . .While you're off having all the fun -- slaying humans, pillaging the town, terrorizing innocent people -- I am stuck standing guard here in Tarren Mill.Perhaps you'll take pity on an old Deathguard like myself?  You see I am collecting human skulls.  And you will be fighting humans for quite some time.  Over the course of your long battle, bring me 30 skulls and I will make it worth your while."
547,"High Executor Darthalia sent me to keep watch of Dun Garok from a distance.  I had set up camp just out of sight.  But when morning came and I had to boil water, I left to gather firewood.When I returned to camp, I discovered my gear was missing.Apparently some dwarven scouts from Dun Garok had passed by and made off with it.  I need my sword!  If you can get it back for me I would be so grateful.  So many dwarves there...it will be quite difficult to find the dirty little thief who stole it."
549,"By the authority of Lady Sylvanas, all members of the organization known as the Syndicate are wanted dead. Those brought into custody or taken prisoner will be summarily executed. They are currently known to be amassing in the ruins of Durnholde Keep, to the southeast of Tarren Mill.A handsome reward is offered to all who bring proof of their deeds to High Executor Darthalia."
550,"Because you fought with such valor and perseverance in the Battle of Hillsbrad, I have written this commendation, extolling your heroics in combat for the high command to recognize.Take this sealed commendation to Varimathras in the Undercity.  Go with pride, <class>."
551,"This parchment is enchanted with a spell, rendering it indecipherable.  But one word at the top of the paper can be read:Nagaz"
552,Master Helcular was almost complete with his transformation into a Lich when a human lynch mob discovered his ritual lair in the hills and brutally killed him.  To make matters worse they buried his corpse in the Southshore cemetery.Such disregard for the great wizard is unacceptable.  As his apprentice I shall see to it that the rains of vengeance fall upon the town of Southshore.We will need Helcular's Rod first.  Yeti overtook his ritual lair.  Undoubtedly one of the beasts has it.
553,"Here, take the Rod of Helcular. You will need it.Helcular fashioned 3 ceremonial pyres as part of his most powerful spell.  The Flame of Azel and the Flame of Veraz lie within the Foothill Caverns. The Flame of Uzel lies in a cave above the caverns, further north in the mountains.The Rod of Helcular must be charged from each of the three flames. Once the ritual is complete, drive the rod into Helcular's grave in Southshore, the heavily guarded human town to the south.  Vengeance shall be ours!"
554,"Prospector Stormpike is a master of decryption and deciphering.  If you take the parchment you found to him, then with luck he can make sense of it.  Stormpike is currently studying in the Prospector headquarters in Ironforge.And when you see him tell him you spoke with me - I've been sending him quite a lot of business lately."
555,"If there's one thing you'll learn about Southshore it's that we have some of the best cuisine north of Stormwind!Take my secret recipe for Turtle Bisque, for example. I've known folks to travel from as far as Darkshire just to enjoy a bowl.  Speaking of which, I haven't been able to make any lately.  I used to head up past Dalaran to Lake Lordamere myself to hunt Snapjaws but it's just too dangerous now. If you bring me some Turtle Meat from the Snapjaws up north and Soothing Spices, I'll whip some up!"
556,"A notable talent of the wizards of Dalaran is their familiarity with elementals: powerful creatures from other dimensions.  The wizards use magical tokens as a means to control these elementals.  Magus Voidglare would like some of these tokens to study.Enter the territories of the Dalaran wizards, west of Hillsbrad, and gather the tokens.You might find the tokens on any citizen of Dalaran, but I suggest hunting at the internment camp.  It's safer than Dalaran itself."
557,"The Magus will be busy studying those stone tokens you gathered, but I know he'll eventually want examples of their counterpart: bracers of binding.  These are set around the wrists of actual elementals, and bind them into the mage's service.Hunt elementals in the ruins of Dalaran and gather their Bracers of Earth Binding, and the Magus will be pleased."
558,"They say that Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore is one of the greatest heroes the Alliance has ever had.  When I grow up, I wanna be a hero of the Alliance too!Do you know Jaina, <name>?  Could you do me a favor, please?  Could you get her autograph for me?  I dunno how to ask her, and she'd probably be too busy for someone like me... but you!  You're an adventurer just like she is!  I bet she'd give you her autograph easy!Please?"
559,"Would you believe it, <name>? Redpath wasn't satisfied with all the murlocs we killed--oh now, don't be modest, you had some hand in it. Now he wants me to bring proof of the dead, hacking off cold, slimy murloc heads to submit for his approval."
560,"You know, <name>, I'd really rather not take these heads... Since you've already got a handle on them, would you mind delivering them to Redpath for me?"
561,"Please inform Lieutenant Orinelle that I would like him to refocus his efforts on the naga infesting the Eastern Strand. When he has results, tell him to report to me in person."
562,"My former mentor in the Stormwind city guard sent a message to me that Alliance High Command is becoming concerned with the threat posed by the naga. From what he's heard, there's good chances for promotion--or at least reassignment--for anyone who proves valuable in this regard.There's just one small problem... I can't handle the naga, <name>. Oh sure, I could break up a drunken barroom brawl, or haul off a belligerent beggar, but the naga are too much for me. You've got to help me, <name>!"
563,"It shouldn't be a problem getting my report seen. The new captain of the guard, Major Samuelson, was my mentor while I was stationed in Stormwind. It should give him more than enough excuse to have me transferred back to the city. I'll need you to carry my report to him, though... wouldn't want ol' Redpath to catch on."
564,"Ain't nothin' that irks me more than losin' these here beautiful horses.  And believe me, we've lost quite a few between them pesky undead creeps, the dang Syndicate gang and all the other good-for-nothin' scoundrels pokin' about these parts.But I swear on my ol' grand-daddy's grave there ain't no bigger menace to our horses here than them Mountain Lions up in Alterac.  Always comin' down from the hills and makin' my life difficult!You fancy yourself a hero?  Go and do somethin' about it then!"
565,"I, the great Bartolo, shall make for you the world famous, Alliance renowned, Yeti Fur Cloak!Travel the planet and find yourself a better cloak, I dare you.  Oh wait, what is that, little <race>?  ""Bartolo, there is no finer cloak!""  Yes, yes!  That, I have heard before.Bartolo requires a Bolt of Wool, a Hillman's Cloak made by a skilled leatherworker, Fine Thread and Yeti Fur, of course!  Bring to me these items and you shall be a happy customer!"
566,"By order of High Executor Darthalia, the human known as Baron Vardus is wanted for crimes against the Forsaken. Vardus is known to be a high-ranking member of the organization known as the Syndicate.He was last spotted in the Uplands in the Alterac Mountains, north of Tarren Mill.He is wanted dead. Bring evidence of his demise to High Executor Darthalia to claim the reward."
567,Dangerous!The following humans of Hillsbrad have been deemed dangerous and are marked for bounty by High Executor Darthalia:Clerk Horrace Whitesteed.  Wanted for the murder of Deathguard Toma.Citizen Wilkes.  Wanted for the murder of Apothecary Eli.Miner Hackett.  Wanted for the murder of Deathstalker Fry.Farmer Kalaba.  Wanted for the ambush of supplies from the Undercity.All of these enemies are hiding and will be hard to find.  A reward will be granted upon notice of their death.
568,"Throm'ka, <class>!Your arrival at Grom'gol is timely, indeed.  As commander of the Warchief's base camp here in the jungle I am bound by honor to ensure the safety of all members of the Horde.  Our mission to provide a safe chain of supply to Stonard is being hampered by some of the local inhabitants.I am putting you in charge of thinning out the raptor population outside of Grom'gol.  Once you have made significant progress, report back to me for reassignment."
569,"When we first arrived in this jungle we did not intend to wage war on the local tribes.  Our mission to supply Stonard is of the highest priority.  But complications have arisen.  A local band of ogres has occupied the Mizjah Ruins to the southeast of Grom'gol.  Despite warnings, they continue to ambush our supply caravans.I am putting you in charge of dealing with these uncooperative ogres.Travel to the ruins and attempt to drive them from the area.  At the very least it will send a firm message."
570,"The power of the jungle's magic must be realized and then harnessed by the Horde.  My rituals have proven successful so far.  I can cast very powerful enchantments.  For you, brave <class>, I shall make a special item indeed.Bring to me some Shadowmaw Panther claws along with a Tigress fang.  Not just any fang will do.  It must be in pristine condition.The beasts lurk throughout the jungle but you will find some close by, just across the river from Mizjah Ruins to the southeast."
571,"What I need from you now will be very difficult to obtain.To hold all these feathers, claws and the pristine fang in place I require a magical tether.  Only an aged gorilla sinew will work.You will only be able to find one on an Elder Mistvale Gorilla.  They are known to forage to the east of Booty Bay.The sinew must be perfect.  It might take quite a few kills for you to find exactly what I need but it will be well worth the hunt."
572,"The items you gathered from the feline beasts of the Vale are only the first requirement for a powerful enchanted item.  These jungle trinkets combined with my shamanistic ritual will provide you with a very useful tool in assisting the Horde and the Warchief.But now you must gather for me some Jungle Stalker Feathers.  The feathers are traditionally worn by the beasts on their armbands.  You will find a tribe of the raptors directly south of Grom'gol, not far from the great arena."
573,"There is but one final reagent needed to complete the enchantment.In the south, towards the western coast, high above the bluffs, lies a Holy Spring.  This spring is the subject of great conflict amongst religious and mystical scholars.  Every race in Azeroth claims that the spring waters were made divine for their people.My final request of you: bring to me Holy Spring Water.  Be warned.  An expedition of naga explorers have advanced upon the spring.  They will need to be dealt with as well."
574,"Now that many of his regular troops are reduced, you must face his highly trained forces.  When they're not in the wilderness slaughtering our rebel soldiers, they are found deep in the back of the Kurzen Compound, in a cave they call the Stockpile.I know many of Kurzen's troops personally, and I know they are skilled, loyal, and cruel.  This is no easy task I set before you, <name>.After you defeat them, report to Lieutenant Doren, my commanding officer.  He will want your report firsthand."
575,"""The finest leathercrafter of the South Seas and the worlds old and new."" That's what they call me. Me! Drizzlik! The finest lea... Ahem. Well.My leather goods are known far and wide as the most exquisite, a connoisseur's choice!I've just received an order from Director Riddlevox of the Tinkers' Union for a dozen of his favorite Excelsior-line boots. Our best sellers, actually.To start on the basic shape, I'll need crocolisk skins from the crocs along the river in northern Stranglethorn."
576,"Avast!  Who goes there?Argh, I am but useless without me special enchanted eye.  Bad enough to have lost me eyes in battle in the first place!  But by some stroke o' luck we docked in Menethil and a traveling wizard enchanted a special glass eye that let me see again.Last night I ended up gettin' jumped by some Bloodsail Buccaneers on me way out.  Took me eye, they did!  Seems those blokes have found their way to Booty Bay.Help an old sea dog out by gettin' me eye back?"
577,"Well, I've got the basic shape of the boots worked out, and they're coming along fine, but the skins you brought aren't going to be quite enough for the inner layers.""What are we going to do, Drizzlik?"" No doubt the question on your lips, and well, isn't it lucky you're talking to Drizzlik, because he's going to tell you what we're going to do!The inner layers will never really be seen, so we'll just get some of the thicker, cheaper skins from the crocs around Lake Nazferiti to fill the boots out."
578,"If there is indeed a goblin mage and water elementals haunting the island, it could mean the Stone of the Tides can be mine!I want you to locate this haunted island... find out what's going on. Oh, and if you perhaps want to find out more about the Stone of the Tides, take this scrip to the Stormwind Library, they should be able to find you a copy of the book I first came across the legend in.Could it be that Gazban actually discovered the Stone...?"
580,"We was splicin' the mainbrace somethin' fierce off of the Overlook Cliffs, ol' Hinterlands just in the distance.  Thought the seas was goin' to swallow us whole.Ol' Slim knows all about liquid courage!  Cap'n had a crate of Pupellyverbos Port we commandeered from a privateer en route to Stormwind.So when that storm off of Hinterlands hit, I busted into the grog.  Big wave hit and tossed them bottles overboard.  Cap'n is goin' to give me a taste o' the cat if ye don't help me get 'em back though!"
581,"A doom, there is.  A doom on my chief's youngest son, Yenniku.  As is a custom with our people, he was given to the Gurubashi Trolls of Zul'Gurub, but after my tribe, the Darkspear tribe, left with the orc Thrall, poor Yenniku was lost to us.  I was sent from distant Orgrimmar, back to Stranglethorn, to search for my chief's son.And I believe the Bloodscalp tribe has him.If you would help me, then hunt the Bloodscalps.  You may find them to the north.  Gather their tusks and return to me."
582,"We must find if Yenniku is dead.Slay the Bloodscalp Headhunters and take from them their Shrunken Heads.  You must gather many, many heads, and I will inspect them to make sure Yenniku's head is not among them.And if Yenniku was killed by the Bloodscalps, then may a 600-year curse fall on the spirit of their chief, Gan'zulah!Go, <name>.  You may find many Headhunters at the ruins of Zuuldaia and Zul'Kunda, along the coast to the north."
583,"Welcome to Stranglethorn!Perhaps you're not aware of this, but that dwarf over there is the one and only Hemet Nesingwary, renowned war hero of the Alliance and master big game hunter. He's not one for welcoming strangers into his camp, but you look like you've seen quite a bit of action in your day, <class>.Being a veteran of many battles himself, Master Nesingwary has a soft spot for fellow heroes.Go and speak with him. Perhaps he can give you some hunting pointers."
584,"Yenniku was not among the heads, and I thank the Great Serpent for it.  But we are no closer to finding him.We must know the truth, and I fear that only the Bloodscalp chief and his witchdoctor know it.  They are the enemies of the Darkspear tribe and will not speak freely, so we must force the truth from their dead lips!Bring me the heads of Gan'zulah and Nezzliok the Dire and place them within this cauldron.They are deep within Zul'Kunda.  Bring their heads...we will then make them talk."
585,"<The head of Nezzliok speaks.>It is true.  I know where the child of the Darkspears was taken.  You have bested me and bound my spirit, but I will say nothing without appeasement!The Bloodscalps war with the Skullsplitters.  To gain my favor, steal from the Skullsplitters 3 of their trophy skulls and place them here with us, so that my spirit will have slaves in the Nether.  One skull must be from their trophy pile in Balia'mah, another from Ziata'jai, and the last from Zul'Mamwe."
586,"<The head of Gan'zulah speaks.>Curse you!  And curse your ancestors!!Only blood and revenge can cool my rage, so if that is your wish, then... do this:Throw yourself into the heart of the Skullsplitters to the east.  Slay the fiercest among them, and if you survive...then break yourself against their chief, Ana'thek the Cruel.  Hah!  Bring me his shattered armor if you can!May he tear off your limbs and leave you to rot and be eaten by carrion."
587,"Ah, the sea life.  I ain't gonna say it's the good life, but it's my life.When I get into port I like to find me a good bottle of grog and some high quality snuff.  Nasty habits but what's a pirate without his vices, right?So you can imagine how heartbroken I was to find out the herbalist here in town has gone and sold out of the stuff.  Says his shipment got hijacked by those damned Bloodsail Raiders.I bet a fearless <class> like you could convince 'em to share the goods, eh?"
588,"<Nezzliok speaks.>You have appeased myself and my chief, so I will tell you that which you seek to discover...Young Yenniku is lost to his clan.He was taken by the witchdoctor Zanzil the Outcast.  Now Zanzil controls him, body and soul, and only the most potent magic could set him free.A magic that you do not have, <class>.Perhaps your Darkspear allies can offer a hope of Yenniku's salvation.  But that, I doubt."
589,"Legends tell of a jewel, hidden deep in the heart of Stranglethorn.  We call it the Mind's Eye, and it has great powers.  If you gain this Eye then, perhaps, we can use it to bring lost Yenniku back from the darkness.I will consult with the spirits of the jungle to find the Mind's Eye.  While I do this, you enter the Crystalvein Mine, southeast of here, and gather Pulsing Blue Shards from Ironjaw Basilisks.  The shards are rare, but we will need their magic to bend the Mind's Eye to our will."
590,"What?What?!You want money? I don't owe you any money.Letter? What letter? Oh, you wanna fight then? All right, mate... let's do this! Owe you any money..."
591,"The Mind's Eye is held by an ogre mage, east of here and deep within the Mosh'Ogg ogre mound.  His name is Mai'Zoth.  I know him from when the Darkspears dwelt in Stranglethorn - he is vicious, and his magic is strong.And if he has the Mind's Eye, then his magic will be stronger still.You must face Mai'Zoth and wrest from him the Mind's Eye.  It is a perilous task, but it is the only hope we have of saving Yenniku."
592,"I have reshaped the Mind's Eye into a Soul Gem.  Its purpose is twofold: you must use it to stun Yenniku, and once stunned place it upon his head to entrap his soul.Then, bring the gem to Nimboya.Yenniku dwells with Zanzil the Outcast, at the Ruins of Aboraz, along the Crystal Shore on the distant Cape of Stranglethorn."
594,"The note reads, in fairly good handwriting:To any that can aid me-Please, my need for help is dire. A great Skymane holds me captive on an island in the South Seas.The stars at night are foreign to me and obscured by the jungle trees, but on the clearest days I see Wild Shore to the northwest, and what seem to be large sailing ships to the southwest.I beg of you, my would-be savior, please help me."
595,"You sure seem eager to work, matey.  Not sure why some land-loving <race> <class> is offering help to the Blackwater Raiders, but I'm not going to turn you away.Our ship just docked here in Booty Bay and word has it that our rivals--those damned, dirty Bloodsail Buccaneers--have been spotted all over southern Stranglethorn.All the boys are too busy hitting the grog and looking for ladies!  What I need is a scout.Check the cove just north of Booty Bay along the Savage Coast and see what you find."
596,"I was sent to Grom'gol  to aid Nimboya on his quest, but... I too have reasons for being here.The Bloodscalp tribe is enemy to our tribe.  Collecting trophies of our enemies gives us power over them.  You may aid our tribe by hunting our enemies.They dwell to the north.  Slay Bloodscalp trolls and take from them their bloody bone necklaces.  Collect many, and your reward will be great."
597,"The map shows Booty Bay with a red ""X"" drawn precisely at the spot at which you are standing.The scribbled text reads:""You men are to secure a camp at this location and keep quiet.  Wait for the signal from the southern command post before attacking.  If anyone approaches you, kill them."""
598,"Now that you have gathered Bloodscalp trophies, I have another task for you.  The Skullsplitter tribe of trolls live to the southeast, and for years we have warred with them.  Although the Darkspears no longer dwell in Stranglethorn, we are bound to our conflict with the Skullsplitters.So, hunt them.  Gather their Split Bone Necklaces and return to me.  Aid us in our war, and you will earn the friendship of the Darkspears."
599,"Shiver me timbers!  So the Bloodsail Buccaneers are planning some sort of attack on Booty Bay?  Why, the nerve of those scoundrels.  Booty Bay will always be run by the Blackwater Raiders!This is bigger than I thought.  Report what you have learned to Fleet Master Seahorn at once!  The ol' sea dog is around town somewhere...."
600,"The Venture Company has a string of operations through Stranglethorn which keeps hard-working goblins, like me, from making honest gold!  Please, you must help me!The Venture Company is mining near the Crystalvein Mine to the north.  They can't get into the mine because of all the basilisks, but they're still able to dig up Singing Crystals from the surrounding hills.Take their crystals from them, and show them they don't have the run of the jungle.And... um... bring me those crystals as proof!"
601,"The water elementals were no doubt summoned by Gazban, the goblin wizard rumored to have discovered the Stone of the Tides. As you may know, the Stone of the Tides curses its bearer, causing him to fade in and out of existence...Perhaps we can find a way to counteract the curse. We can have a mage of Dalaran analyze the magical residue of one of the water elemental's bracers. I need you to go back to the island and retrieve a few specimens."
602,"From what I've heard, the mages of Dalaran are busy with the reconstruction of their destroyed city, I'm sure you can find one of them who will spare some time to look at the bracers. If there's anything I know about mages, they can't resist a magical puzzle.Take the bag of water elemental bracers and see if they can shed any light on the Stone's curse.  Look for the Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver in particular.  I've dealt with him before, and his knowledge is vast."
603,"The mage that is in possession of the Stone is amplifying its power through some focal point... an altar of some sort. You should be able to disrupt it by overpowering it.As it happens, I know just the thing: an ancient dagger, another troll relic. There's just one... little problem.You see, I found the dagger while researching in Stranglethorn, but I gave it to my willful daughter, Catelyn, who ran off to Booty Bay to become a pirate."
604,Crazz speaks highly of your dedication to the Blackwater Raiders.  I am going to trust you with a mission of extreme importance to the fleet.Infiltrate the so-called southern command post the Bloodsail Buccaneers have established on the Wild Shore.  Raid the encampment.  Bring me their charts along with their written orders.  We shall see exactly what those scum are up to.
605,"The Singing Crystals are unique to Stranglethorn, and are very valuable to certain parties.  I can move those crystals, but the cursed Venture Company makes it hard for an honest entrepreneur like myself to gather any!I'd like to hire you.The basilisks in Stranglethorn eat the crystal.  This gives them their hardened skin, and sometimes decent quality crystal can be harvested from it.You can get it from any basilisk, but the less nasty ones are along the shores south of Zul'Kunda, to the north."
606,"If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people who don't pay their gambling debts!  And there are a lot of people who owe me. Think you can help me collect?First, there's ""Shaky"" Phillipe down by the docks.  He owes me plenty after last week's game and I want my due!  But to get it, we'll have to scare him.Go out of town and hunt Elder Mistvale Gorillas.  Find a nice selection of giblets, then take them to Shaky.  Don't let on that they're from an animal; let him think the worst."
607,"Here, take this pouch and give it to Sea Wolf.  And tell him I meant to pay him back!  I swear!!I just got a little drunk and lost my way, and...you know how things are.  He'll understand - you don't have to get rough!"
608,"Blast the nerve of Firallon!  He couldn't sail a skiff through Crystal Lake let alone lead an entire fleet against us.The Bloodsail Buccaneers will pay for their carelessness.  Now that we know their plan of attack, we can counter before they know what hit them.But why send the entire fleet to do the work of one brave adventuring party?  <name>, take some of your most skilled comrades out to Firallon's landing spot and assassinate the Bloodsail leadership.  Their fleet will sink soon after...."
609,"My list is shortening, but there are still people who owe me.Next, we have Maury ""Club Foot"" Wilkins, Jon-Jon the Crow, and Chucky ""Ten Thumbs.""These scurvy dogs' debts are months outstanding and I thought they skipped town to avoid paying up!  Later, I heard they're cursed and bewitched and now wander the jungle ruins.  But I don't care what their fate is - I want what's mine!They're at the Ruins of Aboraz and the Ruins of Jubuwal, northeast of here.  Find them, and collect."
610,"My FATHER sent you? I'd have thought that old codger would have given up on me by now.It wasn't really his fault I ran off, he just shouldn't have expected I'd be willing to live a boring life, reading over musty books and associating with grey-haired, stiff-backed, stuffy mages!If you need my dagger, you'll have to get it back from ""Pretty Boy"" Duncan, one of the Bloodsail Buccaneers. Put something 'tween his shoulders and I'm sure he'll give it up."
611,"So you're looking for an altar of some sort? Well, I'm no expert on troll ruins like my father, but I have heard about a sunken troll city out near that island you're looking for. Maybe you should try there.You got my knife back for me, so I guess you can borrow it... but I want it back when you're done!"
613,"Curses!  That swab Maury put a lock on his foot, and I can't open it!  His loot's inside the foot, and that's what he owes me!We need to find the key to open the lock.  Maury was known to gamble with the Mosh'Ogg ogres, at their mound to the northeast.  And he told me, when he was still alive, that the last time he went to the mound he was chased off after winning too much.  Maybe the Ogres there have his key.But if they do, you might have to kill a load of them to find the right one..."
614,"I used to sail a ship from here all the way to Ratchet, in Kalimdor.  I was a successful captain with a sterling reputation.Until...Those cursed sea giants ruined me!  They smashed my ship, killed my crew, and set me on a lifeboat to Booty Bay.  And one of the giants, Gorlash, stole my Captain's Chest.  He said he wanted it for a snuffbox.  The nerve!I hear Gorlash wanders the coast east of here.  Find him and get back my chest!  Do that, and you'll have earned a captain's gratitude."
615,"After I lost my first ship to those giants, I bought another.  Named Smotts' Revenge, I filled it with supplies and crew, and set out to find the villains.  I found them, but...they beat me.  They smashed Smotts' Revenge, killed my second crew and set me on another lifeboat.This time another of the giants, Negolash, stole my cutlass.Face Negolash and bring me my cutlass!Speak with Sprogger.  He was my cook on the Smotts' Revenge, and survived the last attack.  He can help you find the giant."
616,"Baron Revilgaz has had me keep an ear out for rumors of the strange and out-of-place in Booty Bay and Stranglethorn. I don't usually put much stock in ghost stories, but I heard some sailors in the tavern talking about a haunted island off the coast. Water elementals and a raving goblin ghost, they say.If you're going to go talk to Revilgaz, could you relay that story to him?"
617,"You looking fer work, <name>? I might have some if you're up for a little challenge.I got a friend named Groy who makes a killing selling what the naga call akiris reed: it's some kind of valuable ocean reed. Not too sure what it's for, but he pays well for bundles of the stuff.Ya bring me ten stalks of the stuff, and we'll have business to do. The naga were last seen along the beach to the north of here."
618,"Negolash is a hungry giant.When the giants destroyed our ship, Negolash went straight for my kitchen.  He wasn't hungry for crew like the other giants.  Negolash wanted wine...and my Barbecued Buzzard Wings.  They're my specialty, and I had to go all the way to the Badlands for the recipe!If you want to lure the giant, then get some wine and a heap of buzzard wings.  Put them in our old lifeboat, southeast of here along the coast.  When Negolash smells all that food, he'll come for sure!"
621,"Zanzil the Outcast dwells with his followers in the Jubuwal and Aboraz Ruins, northeast of Booty Bay.  He is exiled from his tribe.  Why? Well...Zanzil has methods of bending the minds of others, and his leaders fear him.  He uses a mixture of jungle plants on his followers to suppress their will and strengthen their bodies.His mixture would be worth much to those who wish to control others.Bring me samples of his mixture, and I will find a use for them."
622,"While you were gone I fixed the pot you brought me.  I even added an extra steam whistle, and look!  There's a new chopper at the bottom that'll cut through leg bones!Yes yes, Krazek's Crock Pot is a 100% cook pleaser!  I'm sure its owner will be satisfied."
623,"<name>, since I have you here, I got a message from Groy while you were gone. He mentioned bein' satisfied with the last shipment that arrived and has a client that wants some more of the stuff right away.I won't be headin' to Theramore for a week, but if you're willin' to make the journey, there's no reason you can't take the stuff for me.Feeling adventurous? You do know where Dustwallow Marsh is, doncha? I'd be careful though, Theramore can be dangerous if you're the wrong kind of crowd."
624,"There is an ornate, well-traveled bridgeEast of Deadwind and south of RedridgeUnderneath there waits something for youSome call it a hint, others a clueThere it will lie for endless tomorrowsBiding its time in the Swamp of Sorrows"
625,A far off land in Kalimdor awaitsWhere peril has dashed hopes and fatesEast of Barrens the weather is harshGloom and danger pock Dustwallow MarshBut there lies a clue for those up to the testWaiting to be found in a cave in the southwest
626,"To Lordaeron! The great land of turmoilWhere brave soldiers with death do toilFind your way through the great unrestThere you will find the end to this questAlong the coast of the Hinterlands, at the base of the great fallsUnderneath the water there does your treasure call!"
627,"There is a mountain cave in Drywhisker Gorge, far to the north in the Arathi Highlands.  In that cave is rare ore: bloodstone.  The bloodstone in this cave is not of the highest grade, but even low-quality bloodstone is valuable... to those with the knowledge to use it.I would like some.I will fix your crock pot, but while I work on it... bring me samples of bloodstone.  Bring me enough, and I'll even give you a bonus.Oh, and if you don't have the skill to mine it... find someone who does!"
628,"With the inside finished, all that's left is to add the outer layer. For this, I use only the best elder croc skins. They are more durable and a better canvas--if you will--for adding the designs and accents that make Drizzlik's Excelsior line.It's hard to find that perfect skin though, the only one that fits my plan is the skin of an elder saltwater crocolisk. The elders only come out to defend the other saltwater crocs, so you might need to kill a few to draw one out."
629,"Long ago, a great shudder of the earth sunk an old troll city beneath the waters of the Savage Coast to the northwest.  We call that place the Vile Reef, for murlocs now reside in the ruins of the city, attacking any who draw close.There is an old tablet among those ruins that tells the ancient tale of Gri'lek, a hero of troll legends.  The tale is sacred to the Darkspear tribe, and although the tablet is too large to move, I want a shard of it to enshrine in our new home in Orgrimmar."
630,"<name>, I put my faith in you and anyone you can muster to help free me. The great Skymane King Mukla is my captor. He commands the beasts of this island, and they keep me here against my will with the aid of this chain. If you can slay him and find the key to this shackle, I shall be indebted to you greatly.I often hear him to the southeast side of the island, but please be careful: he is not to be trifled with."
631,"A tremendous explosion roared through the hills.  'Twas horrible, I tell you!Good soldiers died defending the Thandol Span.  Longbraid says we'll take revenge on the Dark Irons before all is said and done.We're in a world of hurt though and I don't see any reinforcements in sight.  Longbraid sent Ol' Rustlocke to scout the eastern bridge to see if we could secure it.That was days ago.  We haven't the manpower to search for him with Dun Modr under siege.Perhaps you can find him..."
632,It seems as though poor Ol' Rustlocke ran into a Dark Iron ambush.  You notice a parchment next to his clenched fist.Report the grim news to Rhag Garmason and show him what you found.
633,"Heavens no!  Poor Rustlocke.  'Tis quite a tragedy indeed.We must not let his death pass in vain.  This parchment you discovered indicates that Kam Deepfury, the mastermind behind the original attack, arranged for a cache of explosives to be stashed just across the Thandol Span, in Arathi Highlands.If those explosives make it to the bridge, our major supply line to the north will be severed!  The cache must be destroyed, <name>!  Return to me when your mission is complete.You're our only hope."
634,"I ask of you one more small favor, <class>.  We await the reserves of Ironforge.  However, Roggo has knowledge of an Alliance camp to the north in Arathi Highlands at Refuge Pointe.Travel there and seek out Captain Nials.  Ask the good Captain if the Alliance can spare some soldiers to help us reclaim Dun Modr and the Thandol Span."
635,"This shard pulses as you hold it...You feel a sense of pleading coming from the shard, as if someone is trying to communicate, someone who desperately needs your help.A vision appears in your mind - of the northern mountains of Arathi, and of a brilliant crystal jutting from the earth there.You feel drawn to that place."
636,"This book tells the tale of an elemental princess, Myzrael, and of her imprisonment deep underneath the Arathi Highlands.It also tells of a secret outcropping of crystals in the highlands.  These crystals, the Shards of Myzrael, are a window to the princess' prison.If a brave soul found the Shards of Myzrael, the perhaps <he/she> could speak with her..."
637,"The waterlogged and war-torn envelope dissolves in your hands, leaving you with a few pages of a letter in your grasp, written with painstaking care.The letter is addressed to a Mrs. Sara Balloo of Ironforge and begins, ""My dear Sara...."""
638,"With Thoras Trollbane dead and Stromgarde in ruins, Vol'jin has instructed that we make every effort to spirit the legendary sword Trol'kalar from the humans' hands, so that we might use it in our coming battles against the trolls of Zul'Gurub.Zengu, one of our seasoned hunters, was dispatched to Hammerfall in northeastern Arathi Highlands to oversee its procurement."
639,"In ancient times, trolls fought against the Arathorian Empire and our most capable adversary, Lord Ignaeus of Strom, named Trollbane. He rode into battle wielding Trol'kalar--troll slayer, in their ancient tongue.But now the sons of Trollbane are weakened, their stronghold brought to ruin.The sword is protected by several sigils that were divided among the survivors of Stromgarde, and we must retrieve them.The first was taken by the Syndicate, one of their men in Stromgarde should have it."
640,"Thoras Trollbane's tomb is protected by three sigils--the first of which you retrieved from the Syndicate. The other two will be harder to get, as they're held by the firmly entrenched Stromgarde militia.The sigil of Thoradin was divided into five pieces by Thoras' son, Galen, and dispersed among the Stromgarde defenders. Retrieve the pieces and bring them to Tor'gan, the troll shaman, he will be able to bind them into the complete sigil."
641,"The reconstruction worked flawlessly. The sigil can now be used to unlock the seal on Trollbane's tomb. Return it to Zengu, no doubt he has additional tasks for you to complete."
642,"My name is Myzrael.  I am a princess of the earth, and my captors, the giants, have trapped me deep beneath the Arathi Highlands.  These crystal shards are the only way I can speak with the surface world.Please help me.  Allies of the giants, the Drywhisker Kobolds, have a shard like this one in their Drywhisker Gorge, to the east.  To power the cluster, you must gather Motes of Myzrael from the kobolds and apply them to it.I beg you, <name>, aid me!"
643,"Though they can barely be said to control Stromgarde, let alone the whole of Arathi Highlands, the human prince trots the remnants of his cavalry over the countryside. I can't understand why he does it, but who understands the way the humans think, hm?Whatever his reasoning, more importantly, he has given one of the sigils to Lieutenant Valorcall, their cavalry leader. Locate him and bring his sigil back to me."
644,"The final of the sigils needed to unlock the tomb of Thoras Trollbane is held by his son personally. He resides deep within Stromgarde, in a chapel in the militia-held districts. Prince Galen is well protected and no slouch of a warrior himself, so this task could prove most difficult."
645,"What's this? With the four sigils brought together, they have formed together to create one sigil. There can be no doubt that this will be able to break the wardings placed upon Trollbane's tomb.Trollbane's remains are entombed in the Sanctum behind the chapel in Stromgarde. Retrieve Trol'kalar."
646,"The light slowly fades, the sword Trol'kalar, held within a stone sheath has been released."
647,"Had quite a bit of the ol' Moonshine last night!  Longbraid would have my head if he knew that I passed out during my watch.The noggin hurts something fierce.  Felt as though a whole brigade of siege engines passed overhead, all that rumbling.Oh my, look at the time! I promised Brewmeister Bilger in Southshore that I'd repay my debt to him by sending some Moonshine.But there are just 15 minutes left before I'm overdue!  Take him this batch, would you please?  And hurry!"
648,"The gnome's voice crackles once again from the robot:""I need to move OOX-17/TN to an open, safe place so it can begin a lengthy take-off procedure.  It has built-in cloaking, but I need time on my end to make it operational again.  I need you to escort the robot from its current location to, let's say, Steamwheedle Port!  That should be a perfect place, and long enough, to get things on line!""""Escort it safely to the port, and then come talk to me in Booty Bay!  Oglethorpe Obnoticus - out!"""
649,"I've got some salvage work for you, and if you're an aficionado of fine ripple like I am, then you'll love this task.  Ripple!It's a drink, you dummy.An abandoned Horde outpost has a stash of Hinterlands Honey Ripple from when they were in business.  You can't get fine ripple like that anymore!  One of Malton's dummy associates knows the shot, so you'll go out there and bring me a case of packaged ripple, and two for my own collection!  Talk to Malton, he'll fill you in on the details."
650,"The elf you will need to talk to is Gilveradin Sunchaser.  He can name any wine, vintage and all, just by smell alone!  He can package up the ripple we need, so you'll need to talk with him.  We need six bottles for packaging, two for dad, and how ever many he'll want... and believe me, he'll want some.  When you've packaged the ripple and got dad's two bottles, come back here!Gilveradin's camp is near some high elf lodge in the Hinterlands, and those high elves are not good.  Trust me."
651,"Four Stones of Binding are scattered throughout Arathi.  These stones keep me pinned beneath the earth.To unlock them you must unlock the strongest: the Stone of Inner Binding.  And to do that, you must gather keys from the other three.These stones are watched by guardians, but if you are clever, or lucky, you may find ways to banish them."
652,"Opening the Stones of Binding loosened much of my confinement, but a lock still holds me chained.  It is the Keystone you see among this circle of stones.  And the key is held by one of my captors, the stone watcher Fozruk.You must obtain that key, which the stone watchers call the Rod of Order, from Fozruk and use it to open the Keystone.<name>, you have done so much to aid me.  Just a little more...and my gratitude will shake the very foundations of the earth!"
653,"<Myzrael speaks.>Free!  I AM FREE!  I am free to gather strength, hidden from my captors.  For if they faced me now they would surely overpower and again imprison me.But in time I will confront the giants, and they will regret their wardship of me!You are a noble ally, <name>.  I will need your help again in time.  When I am ready, I will need you to summon me to the surface.Speak with Gerrig Bonegrip.  He is in Ironforge, in a shop of the Forlorn Cavern.  He knows how I can be summoned."
654,"Activating the power source makes the field testing kit start to glow and vibrate.  It would seem to be working as planned.According to Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle, you now have two hours to collect the data you need in the Tanaris desert.  If you do not collect it within two hours, all the data will be lost and you will need to buy another power source from him.Return to him when you have completed the task."
655,"It is still clear to me, like yesterday... So many years without hope, with wood and steel to bind me to this terrible place. Then finally, finally! There was the Warchief. Doomhammer in his midnight plate, his warhammer held high.It was... too terrible... That the blow of a coward would strike down our greatest hero. From behind he charged on his horse, and then his lance ran him through... I fell to my knees. What hope was there? What hope is there..."
656,"You must defeat Myzrael before she grows in strength.  If you do not, then once she has gathered enough power she will challenge her captors!  There are some who think they can control her, but if she can be controlled then why did the giants chain her in the first place??Crazy logic, eh?To defeat her, summon her at the Shards of Myzrael where you first spoke with her.  Defeat her and gather her Eldritch Shackles, then bind them to the Shards of Myzrael.Do that, and she will again be trapped."
657,"<Quae begins to go through the folder.>This IS interesting. Seems Apothecary Jorell has been working on some deadly experiments here at Go'Shek. Not sure what that has to do with Hillsbrad, but Phin wouldn't like it if we let it continue.We had a run-in with some orcs while you were gone, and I'm not in good enough shape to help Kinelory. If you're up for it, she's going to need some protection when she goes down to the farm to steal whatever research Jorell still hasn't sent to Tarren Mill."
658,"So, Phin sent you to check on us? Not surprised--he worries too much.We've been watching the farm for days, and Kin claims she saw a courier come out of that small house to the south not long ago.She talks a lot, but I can always trust her senses when we're in dangerous areas.You wouldn't happen to be a skilled tracker, would you? We think the courier might be carrying notes to Tarren Mill. If we could get our hands on those documents, it might shed some light on what's happening in Hillsbrad."
659,"Hail, and well met, <name>. I lead a group of adventurers investigating odd happenings in this area.My cousin in Hillsbrad recently put down his dog Stanley because the animal mystically grew to an immense size and savagely attacked anyone who came near him.I believe the undead are involved, and we're looking for signs to prove as much.Two of my companions, Quae and Kinelory, headed to the Go'Shek Farm in the Arathi Highlands, and haven't checked in for days. Find them for me? I grow concerned."
660,"All right, <name>. I'm ready if you are.Shall we?"
661,"I've seen Kinelory look way worse after a night in the tavern than she does now. You obviously did a good job protecting her.These items she brought back from the farm should at least let Phin get an idea of what's going on out here in Arathi. Just to make sure there's no retaliation after your attack, we're going to stay here for a bit longer. Would you be willing to head back to Southshore and talk to Phin?"
662,"O'Breen led the ships into the cove.  We were certain this is where the treasure could be found.  The Harbinger docked safely but as the Maiden's Folly and Spirit of Silverpine approached the tides began to lower.  Strangest thing I've ever seen!Those two ships ran aground into something... some sort of temple in the reef.  They sank so quickly, was quite a tragedy.We need to retrieve their Logs as well as their Charts before we leave.  We can't leave that information behind for prying eyes!"
663,"Lolo sees a tiny <race>! Always on the lookout, Lolo is!Welcome to Faldir's Cove.  Captain O'Breen said we'd only be here for a few hours.  Just long enough to gather the treasure and get back to Booty Bay.But Lolo thinks we're going to be here a lot longer than that.  We lost the other two ships from our formation.  Poor Spirit of Silverpine and Maiden's Folly.  On the bottom of the sea they rest now!Lolo suggests you talk to Captain O'Breen if you plan on sticking around here."
664,"Argh, 'tis a horrible life. I should be in a watery grave right now, not sittin' here by the fire, breathin' fresh air.The crew tried so hard to save my beautiful Maiden's Folly. Bless the boys, bless their hearts.O'Breen made it to shore safely but we weren't so lucky. The seas just sank on us, I swear.One second we're afloat and the next water is rushin' in. And those beasts! Killed all the survivors. Horrible naga scum. I went black and ended up here, saved.I want those beasts dead."
665,"Now that we are full-fledged Blackwater Raiders it is our job to help Mr. O'Breen locate the lost elven treasure.It is next to impossible to find the gems in the dark sea without aid. The doctor has constructed some goggles that will help. He needs the goggles charged with the energy derived from the enchanted stone in the cave just up the hill.But the cave is cursed! When we get close, we get ambushed. Defend me and I can harness the energy from the stone into the goggles."
666,"The treasure has been on the sea floor so long that the gems have calcified into thick stone. But the power harnessed in these goggles will allow you to locate them easily.A little gnomish ingenuity goes a long way!So borrow the Goggles of Gem Hunting, <name>, and see if you can collect some of the lost treasure for Captain O'Breen.I'd swim down there myself but...um...well, I have important scientific business to tend to up on the safe, dry land....er, yeah."
667,"This is bad. It seems the Daggerspines are amassing for an attack.Naga are known for their ruthlessness in battle. They will keep attacking until I am dead.I don't value my own life above that of my crew members, but you must help to defend me. The crew will not be able to make it back to Booty Bay without my knowledge of the seas.The naga will be coming from the sea. I need you to remain up here with me to fend off the attack. Man the cannon and drive them back.Are you ready, <name>?"
668,"Let's not leave Captain O'Breen waiting. He'll want to see these gems first hand. After all, that's why we're here!And after a few weeks of consorting with these pirates, the professor and I have realized the last thing that's good for our health is to be caught hanging on to their treasure.Here, <name>, take these to O'Breen."
669,"Fleet Master Seahorn will want to hear about our find at once.But as you can see, we're not in much of a position to get out of here. Not only is the tide too low, but those damned creatures we disrupted are keeping a close eye on our movements.You can be of great service to the Blackwater Raiders if you can get word to Fleet Master Seahorn in Booty Bay that we discovered the treasure and are working on extracting more.  Take him this sample as proof."
670,"Say, <name>, you seem to be an adventurous type. My fleet is stuck in Booty Bay until we can restock.There are some heavy things brewing here and abroad and I need to get some top secret correspondence to Shakes O'Breen who is tied up off the Arathi coast.Can I trust you to deliver this message safely and in confidence?"
671,"I have felt a strangeness in the air... a feeling that simmers in my blood. I had my suspicions. I set off to find the source of my unease and discovered to the west, at Northfold Manor, the residual traces of demonic summoning. As I got close, my blood began to boil and the rage within me grew.On the ground I spied an amulet of bloodstone, used to assist in demonic summoning. The one I found was depleted, however. I'll need another to examine, but I dare not return to the manor. Can you bring me some?"
672,"We tried to settle him in, cheer him up, telling him stories of our mighty city at Orgrimmar in Kalimdor, but nothing would move him.Tales of our young Warchief, Thrall, who bears the armor and hammer of Orgrim... but, perhaps... Perhaps! A demonstration of our newly found shamanistic magic would give him new hope. It is worth a try!A small object we could make for him, yes... Bring me some raptor eyes, and I will see what I can do."
673,"There is no doubt in my mind that a powerful warlock resides within the walls of Stromgarde. From time to time, using an arcane magical relic, this warlock has summoned forth terrible demons in large numbers. We must remove the source of his energy.Find the warlock and kill him. Bring me whatever magical object you find on his person, and I will take steps to destroy it and see that its power is not used to taint this land any longer."
674,"Here, take this amulet to Gor'mul, and see if the raptors' strength can awaken the flame of the warrior that once burned through his veins."
675,"<Gor'mul tosses the amulet into the ground.>Tor'gan sent you, didn't he? Pah! Why he feels some mercy towards me I would not understand. Mercy was denied me when I was not allowed to die with my Warchief in battle. A cruel blow fate has dealt me..."
676,"Weaklings... all of them. You, <class>, what are you looking at? Think you're something special, huh? Why not prove it?The Hammerfall outpost in Arathi's under attack. Unless we send them help soon, their demise is imminent.But before you go rushing off, you may want to test your skills first. Northeast of Stromgarde in Arathi is an ogre mound inhabited by the Boulderfist tribe. When you can handle the ogres and enforcers there, then report to Drum Fel in Hammerfall."
677,"The Witherbark trolls and Boulderfist ogres of Arathi are working together to rid us from this land, but we shall not meet our fates at their, or anyone else's, hand. We will slay them and show them that we, too, have a home here.The trolls turned their backs to us; the ogres would use us for food and bedding if we allowed them to--these things shall not be.We start our attack on the Witherbark trolls to the south of here. Slay them in droves, and only return when their camps run thick with blood."
678,"Your strength is evident, <name>. Now to see how you fare against a real enemy.The Boulderfists have a lair to the southwest of here towards the dwarven bridge, and, if I'm not mistaken, the maulers and magi there shall present to you a greater challenge--they have done so to us thus far.Slay as many as you can and come to me in body when you are successful, or come to me in spirit when you fail. I shall give praise to your tenacity in battle either way."
679,"The head of the beast is ready to be taken off... with great force, <name>. You have shown every sign that you are able to help us with this final mighty blow. The leaders of these attacks have made their lair within the ruins of Stromgarde, a glaring symbol of human frailty.Find and slay those Boulderfist lords and their lackey shaman who would try and drive us from these lands."
680,"You serve my husband well, <class>, but he does not know why Hammerfall is under attack.Or'Kalar, Mug'thol's pawn in Stromgarde, has an intense hatred for my husband, and wishes nothing more than my husband's death for defeating him years ago.My auguries tell me that Or'Kalar has laid a trap for my husband, so I have hidden signs of the ogre's presence from him.My husband will rush off foolishly if he learns of the ogre's whereabouts and I would ask for your help in slaying the creature."
681,"We are fighting a war for Stromgarde, and we are losing.  The ogres, the Syndicate and we have divided our once great city, and each faction battles the other into a bloody stalemate.But our forces dwindle while our enemy grows.We need help from the town of Southshore, but supplies are difficult to receive while the Syndicate holds territory between us.Go to the Syndicate base in Northfold Manor and slay them.  Then, perhaps, pressure on our supply trains will lessen and more will get through."
682,"The Syndicate in Stromgarde do battle with our contingent of militia there. In order to urge the rabble to fight our more disciplined troops, the Syndicate leaders have placed a bounty on our soldiers, awarding gold for each Stromgarde Badge gathered off killed militiamen.We want those badges retrieved - we cannot allow the cutthroats to take trophies from our brave fallen!Enter the Syndicate-controlled area of Stromgarde and hunt them for our badges."
683,"<name>, I have but a small request to ask of you.Take this note I have prepared to our great monarch of Ironforge, King Magni Bronzebeard. 'Tis a small task to ask of one such as yourself, someone who has shown great valor to the cause of the Alliance thus far.For me to go before the King in my grief-ridden state would not serve the purpose of my cause.  Surely you understand."
684,"A bounty has been placed on the head of Marez Cowl, a high-level advisor and operative of the Syndicate.  She was last seen within the Syndicate controlled territory of Stromgarde.Bounty may be collected from Captain Nials.Be warned: Marez is a skilled and cunning Warlock, known for her trafficking with demons.  Extreme caution is advised when hunting her."
685,"The Stromgarde Militia has placed bounties on the heads of Lord Falconcrest, and his bodyguard Otto.  Falconcrest heads the Syndicate's efforts in the Arathi Highlands, and his death would cause a major disruption in those efforts.His bodyguard Otto, although not a strategic target, is a fierce opponent and has killed dozens of our defenders.Their bounties may be collected from Captain Nials."
686,"I do not expect good dwarves like Mrs. Balloo to understand why the travesties of war must be endured for the greater good of our people. The loss of her husband, and the loss of every dwarf that fights in the name of the Alliance, weighs heavy on my soul.While I cannot bring her husband back from the Twisting Nether, I can pay tribute to him.I am going to commission a memorial to Sully Balloo to be built by Grand Mason Marblesten.Send word to him now, <class>. You shall be custodian of my bidding."
687,"Theldurin the Lost was once a member of our order, the Twilight's Hammer.  But he lost his mind and scorned our teachings.  And before he fled from us, he stole the scroll of Myzrael!  We could not catch him, but rumors say he hides in the Badlands, gibbering and mad."
688,"<Myzrael speaks.>Free!  I AM FREE!  I am free to gather strength, hidden from my captors.  For if they faced me now they would surely overpower and again imprison me.But in time I will confront the giants, and they will regret their wardship of me!You are a noble ally, <name>.  I will need your help again in time.  When I am ready, I will need you to summon me to the surfaceSpeak with Zaruk in Hammerfall.  He knows how I can be summoned."
689,"So our good King would like a memorial built in honor of a soldier named Sully Balloo?  And you say the poor chap died during the Thandol Span tragedy?Bah, will there ever be peace on Azeroth?Nonetheless, any commission from the King is of utmost importance. To build a truly epic and lasting piece I want to work with one of the finest stones available. Travel to Darrow Hill in Hillsbrad and gather for me some Alterac Granite."
690,"Greetings, <name>. You have the look of an adventurer about you, and I have a task that needs some tending to.Archmage Trelane, my original master, fled Stromgarde in the Arathi Highlands not too long ago, and he's asked me to help him in recovering some of the items he left behind.The city fell under siege, and he attempted to defend the Tower of Arathor, but to no avail. I have agents in the Highlands already, but they've requested I send more aid. Are you interested?"
691,"Archmage Malin sent Skuerto and I here to collect reagents for him. I was at a loss as to how I was going to collect the items, but now that you're here, I think my problem's solved.I need the following: Witherbark tusks, Witherbark medicine pouches and a shadow hunter knife.Could you find those for me? The Witherbark live to the southeast of Arathi."
692,"The Scroll of Myzrael...the Scroll of Myzrael?!  You don't want that!  Its magic can pull Myzrael to the surface world and if you do that, we are in trouble!Or...maybe it's too late.  Maybe she already is free.  Maybe she's just gathering strength before unleashing herself upon us.  If so, then you'll NEED the scroll!...too bad it's destroyed.  Enraged elementals stole it and tore it up and now fight over the fragments.But if you can gather those fragments, maybe we can fix it..."
693,"Hey, <name>. Sorry to be so short with ye earlier... and no, that ain't a pun.I figured out where Trelane's first item ended up: Kor'gresh has it in Boulderfist Hall. An' by the way he was throwing down blasts of ice at his kin to keep them in line, he must be close to figurin' out how to use all of its powers.Boulderfist Hall's south of here an' then east of Thandol Span. Find the ogre an' get back that wand.While you're gone, I'll figure out what we're gonna do about Stromgarde."
694,"All rested?Here's our next step: there're ogres all around the Tower of Arathor in Stromgarde. We're gonna need to activate the tower's defenses if you're gonna stand a chance against 'em an' still make it to the items alive. To do that, we're gonna need some gems the Boulderfist shaman have taken a liking to. They took 'em from the tower, but they're not gonna stay in their possession for long.Get one of them gems an' bring 'em to Kryten--he knows the spell to enchant 'em so they'll work as a key."
695,"Here you are, <name>. The gem only needs to be pressed against one of the pedestals near the base of the tower to activate its defenses. Use it when you're ready to enter the tower and find Trelane's remaining items.Good luck to you. I'll be awaiting your return here at the camp. Oh, and speak to Skuerto before you leave. He'll give you the rest of the details you'll need."
696,"Here's what your lookin' for: Trelane's phylactery, Trelane's orb, an' Trelane's ember agate.All three should be in chests within the tower an' you shouldn't have a problem opening the chests on your own; you just have to be careful of the ogres.The tower's defenses won't take care of 'em on their own; you'll need to have your weapons at the ready. Those ogres find out you're there and stealing from 'em, an' they'll be sure to put the hurt on you.Be careful, an' good luck."
697,"Take this letter back to Stormwind and let Malin know that Kryten an' I'll be home soon. He'll reward you well for helping us here, <name>, of that I've no doubt.Travel safely."
698,"I'm working on getting some supplies together for our outpost near the beach to the east--Tok'kar does what he can, but between shifts of guard duty and cooking for his soldiers there's not much time left in the day.They do enjoy cooking up some sawtooth meat when they can, but I haven't had time to get them another shipment. Would you mind helping them out?The young sawtooths aren't as tasty as the older ones, so stay clear of those; give them a year or two to get to full size."
699,"With the threat of murlocs along the coast, we're stationed out here to protect--or warn if the force is too large--of any coming threats to Stonard. It doesn't give us much time for relaxation, and we could use some more help if you're able.The sawtooth snappers' claws make for fine weapons when properly prepared. Bring me some of their claws and I'll see you're rewarded with one of our weapons in thanks for the fresh meat and the good company."
700,"Ah, such fine stone comes from Lordaeron.  Such a shame the land is in such shambles.But the Memorial came out quite well! I should think the King will be most pleased with it.Now if you will, please send word to His Majesty that the Memorial is complete as requested."
701,"With some additional objects, I will be able to create an item that will imbue Gor'mul with the guile of the raptor! With the power of the raptor flowing through him, Gor'mul will know our new power and rediscover the warrior that lies dormant!I will require raptor hearts to fashion the item and spell."
702,"Take this orb and use its energy to give Gor'mul the essence of the raptor. Surely this will invigorate his spirit and give him new purpose in life. With him returned to normal, we can explain to him the current state of the Horde, and we will have a great warrior's assistance in our unceasing battles."
703,"Oh yes, my barbecued buzzard wings are a favorite!  The sauce is rich and the meat is tangy.  And the smell will bring the hungry running from miles away!I have everything I need to cook up a batch.  Everything...except the buzzard wings!If you want some then get me the buzzard wings.  Bring me enough, and I might even share the recipe with you!"
704,"The last report I received from Agmond is troubling, more so now that he's dead!  He mentioned that his diggers uncovered ""ancient urns"" at the dig site outside Uldaman.  I fear that the urns he found at that site incited the troggs, just as did the idols I found here.I need you to get those urns for our studies.  Go to the Uldaman site, gather the urns, then return to me."
705,"The Badlands is a harsh place, filled with vicious predators and bold scavengers.  Scary, especially for a short little goblin.  To survive, I have to be tricky!I know the recipe for flash bombs.  I use those to scare away wildlife.  But I'm running low on one of the ingredients: crushed blue pearl powder.  Get me some and I'll make it worth your efforts.Heh, and I hope you have good boots on.  The Blue Pearls I need are found from clams at the Vile Reef.Yep, the Vile Reef in Stranglethorn!"
706,"As an apprentice to Feranor Steeltoe, I learned his special technique for imbuing weapons with fiery enchantments. Last I heard of him, he was working at a smithy with a hunting party up in Lordaeron.I can't tell you too many of the details about the process, but I can tell you it requires blood from a rare, still-beating black drake whelp's heart. I don't have much to do waiting for word from Ironforge. If you bring me a heart from the whelps in Lethlor Ravine, I'll show you my skill!"
707,"<name>.  I received reports from Prospector Ironband at his excavation site in Loch Modan--he needs some legwork done concerning another of our excavations.I don't have more details than that, but if you want to stretch your legs then go speak with Ironband."
708,"The surface of this metallic black box is heavily pitted, as if it had been immersed in acid - it must have been sitting in the giant condor's stomach for a long time.Turning the box over, a symbol is found stamped on its bottom.  Below the symbol are the words:""Engine #19 - Ironforge Siege Brigade"""
709,"Oh my!  Oh my!  There is a doom approaching.  Mark me!  A doom!No, I cannot speak of it...cannot utter their names or they may hear me!  But if we learn, yes, if we learn more of them...then maybe we can learn how to foil them!Maybe.Go into Uldaman.  No!  I said it!  You must find...find the tablet of...Ryun'eh.  Yes, find it!  And don't make me speak that name again!It is deep in that place, in an ancient chest.  That's where it hides...in a chest crafted before the works of any dwarf."
710,"Here in the Badlands I've stopped to work on my latest project: my shackles of elemental binding.When complete, they will allow mages to summon even more powerful elementals for use in even greater capacities. To start things off, I need small stone shards to test some of my newest offensive spells along with a few gizmos I've pieced together.The shards are easily collected from the lesser rock elementals to the west of here. Could you bring me some?"
711,"<name>, you've already proven more able than all my apprentices combined.The next parts I need require a little more strength. Large stone slabs can be found on rock elementals if you're careful enough. Their bodies are stronger and larger, and therefore more prone to having pieces large enough for my tests. You can find them further west of here or southeast along the mountains' edges.Take your time; I'll need a while to test these smaller pieces you brought me."
712,"<name>, there's one more part I need from the elementals here in the Badlands: the bracers of rock binding from the greater rock elementals. By my calculations, those bracers should be enough to gauge the strength of my own shackles.My attempts at scrying the greater rock elementals showed a group of them southwest of here, near some ogres if I recall.Bring me 5 of their bracers just so I have extras. Servo's notorious for misplacing my reagents and research."
713,"Let me tell you something about Frost Oil: nothing can keep an engine or gears from overheating quite like it.Its cooling properties are extraordinary, and its longevity as a lubricant without equal. That's not all: it also aids in retaining enchantments on magical items.I need a vial of it to increase the magical capacity of my shackles and make them powerful enough to stop our summoned friend from killing us all.Bro'kin, a goblin friend of mine, can teach you to make it. He's in Alterac."
714,"<name>, you've done your job well beyond all standards.<Lotwil's obviously distracted by his work.>If we ever meet in Kharanos, feel free to come apply for work.Whoops! Quick, grab the... yes, that. Thanks.Now I just need one more thing. It's a small part, but rather crucial, I'm afraid: a gyrochronatom.If you could just go grab one and bring it to me, I should be ready to complete this."
715,"I'm thinking those items you acquired for Lotwil are going to be the least of our worries, <name>. On the other hand, you've proven more than adept at the sciences Lotwil holds sacred, so how about helping me out?I need an invisibility potion and a healing potion; both might come in handy real soon if he pulls this off.In return, I'll give you this recipe for a potion I've been developing while learning from Lotwil. It's based on some of the research he's been doing here in the Badlands."
716,"I know how cheap Lotwil can be, <name>, so let me make you something for all your troubles. Maybe it'll even help protect you from the coming atrocity that is Lotwil's newest invention.I've been working with all the extra stones you collected for him, and I can make some nice bracers that you might want to use. They're enchanted, of course.I'll just need patterned bronze bracers crafted by a blacksmith so I can complete the bracers I'm making for you."
717,"It has become obvious that we cannot ensure that Blacklash and Hematus will remain imprisoned in Lethlor. That black dragons have taken up residence there, and that the ogres managed to steal the Sign indicates that more drastic measures will have to be taken.The drakes' prison is maintained by three runestones that may only be retrieved using the Sign of the Earth. Those runestones can then be used to break the seal which imprisons them.<name>... assure that their dreams are eternal."
718,"In our hurry to leave the Uldaman excavation site, we were forced to abandon many wagons and crates of supplies along the way. The local ogres from Camp Kosh have been on our abandoned equipment like vultures on a rotting corpse. Don't smell much better, either. Than the corpses, I mean.Anyways, they took the cart that was carrying all our weapons and such... so--well, this is a bit embarrassing--we haven't been able to get any food.We're in a bit of a pickle here, suppose you could help us out?"
719,"Hey, <name>. Be careful 'round here. There be Dark Iron dwarves all around--looked like the Shadowforge clan.They just attacked the excavation site I was workin' at--killed nearly everyone there, including my boss Hammertoe. I barely escaped with me life.The site's just to the north of here, and I'm tryin' to plan a way to get some of our supplies back, especially me lucky pick.Think you'd be up to helpin' me out some? One of those damned Dark Iron must have my pick! Could be anyone of them."
720,"<There is text roughly scribbled in chalk on the map.>""Ryedol,They're taking me to Uldaman. Send help.-Hammertoe"""
721,"<name>, can ye find him? Can you find Hammertoe in Uldaman?If those dirty Shadowforge are holdin' him hostage to figure out what he knows about the titan excavations, then all of Ironforge could be in huge trouble.For a long time now those Dark Irons have been lookin' for magics to make more powerful golems. Hammertoe was doin' the same, of course, but only to stop them.They're probably keepin' him alive until they learn what he knows.Ye've got to hurry if you're gonna save him!"
722,"Ye're brave... <cough>... to come into Uldaman fer me, <class>.If ye're really here to help... ol' Hammertoe, then... <cough>... you'll need to find... me amulet.Deepshadow's got it... Magregan Deepshadow. He's 'round here... in the ruins fer sure. That amulet'll lead 'em... <cough>...  right to the scrolls if he ain't stopped. It's up to you, <name>. Please... get that amulet.The scrolls will surely help the Dark Irons create even more powerful golems. I just know it. I can feel it in me bones."
723,"<Hammertoe holds his wounds and takes a moment to regain his composure before speaking again.>Find Ryedol, <name>. Bring 'im me amulet. <cough cough> He'll... <cough> figure out what to do. He knows I was seeking the origins of our people, and he... <cough>... knows it was also my mission to stop the Shadowforge clan. They must not be allowed to find the scrolls... <cough>"
724,"Okay, okay... who would know what to do?Historian Karnik! That's it!He's in Ironforge. He'll be able to help. He and Hammertoe were workin' together to find the lost artifacts in Uldaman.Guess the Shadowforge found out the two of them knew more than they were lettin' on.Tell Karnik what's happened to Hammertoe and give him the amulet--he'll tell you what needs to be done next."
725,"<name>, run and find Advisor Belgrum as quickly as you can. Tell him what you've witnessed and ask him how he wants us to proceed. This note will explain more to him.In the meantime, I will take the time to speak to Hammertoe's spirit. Maybe he knows something that will help us put a stop to those Shadowforge cretins' activities in the Badlands. We can only pray."
726,"<Advisor Belgrum reaches the end of the note, and his eyes widen for a moment.>Och, these are evil tidings.<name>, please return to Historian Karnik and tell him on the king's authority to act on this information swiftly and decisively. He must halt the Shadowforge's activities in the Badlands."
727,"The Tablet tells much.  But not enough!  Not nearly enough!There is a book, a digest that Yagyin wrote in ages past.  The ... people I fled ... they keep this book in many places.  And their most learned study it.  It holds vast knowledge.  Knowledge to protect us!Go to Gerrig Bonegrip.  He is in a shop in Ironforge, in the Forlorn Cavern.  Show him this sigil and he'll think you one of them.  Ask him for Yagyin's Digest ... and bring it to me!"
728,"The tablet tells much.  But not enough!  Not nearly enough!There is a book, a digest that Yagyin wrote in ages past.  The... people I fled from... they keep this book in many places.  And their most learned study it.  It holds vast knowledge.  Knowledge to protect us!Go to Keeper Bel'dugur in the Undercity of Lordaeron.  Show him this sigil and he'll think you one of them.  Ask him for Yagin's Digest...and bring it to me!"
729,What an honor it was when Master Greywhisker assigned me to work under the guidance of the great Prospector Remtravel. At the academy in Ironforge everyone knew of Remtravel's great discoveries.But the prospector is rather... um... oblivious ...to his surroundings.We had uncovered evidence of a great society. Horrible golems sprang forth from the ground and overran the site. Remtravel never seemed to notice. I ran back to Auberdine for help.Please travel south and see if the prospector is okay!
730,"How nice it is to see a <class> interested in the great archeological wonders of our world.Oftentimes our work is dismissed as mere hobby by our friends in the Alliance. But what many fail to realize is that recent discoveries in Khaz Modan have proven that a great and powerful force threatens all of Azeroth, from Lordaeron to Kalimdor.I am most worried about my crew that I sent to Darkshore. They haven't sent word in weeks.Travel to Auberdine and look for a clue as to their whereabouts."
731,"So then, Hollee... oh that's right, you are not Hollee. Where's Hollee?Bah, that's beside the point. We must find that stone brush... I mean the mysterious fossil! We must find that fossil. The Explorers' League in Darnassus will want some indication as to what I've been doing.Let me know when you are ready and we will hunt down that brush.... I mean fossil! We shall find something in writing to satisfy the League.So are you ready yet?"
732,"I heard from Sigrun that you have been a great help to him. Perhaps I might enlist your help. I was sent here by my master, Krasus of the Kirin Tor, to put an end to the trouble brewing in Lethlor Ravine.I cannot divulge the exact nature of my assignment here or the tasks that I must undertake, but be assured it is of vital importance.A band of wandering ogres, sometimes seen near Camp Boff, stole an object called the Sign of the Earth; I must have it. Bring it to me, and I will tell you more."
733,"It's going to be tough going here if I can't manage to scrounge up some materials to construct some defenses and other necessities. I've noticed that the ogres in the area seem to be well equipped with scrap metal. Maybe the stories of siege engines in the Badlands weren't so far off after all...Anyways, the Prospector's been getting worried about the state of our little camp, so I'd like to get working soon if I can.The main ogre camp is at Dustbelch Grotto, a good trek to the west of here."
734,"Wonderful, wonderful.<Lotwil looks up at you for a moment before going back to his shackles.>Go speak to Lucien, <name>. I need a cog #5. Bring it to me, will you?"
735,"Yagyin's Digest, eh?  Are you starting a new chapter of us, somewhere?  Never mind, it is not my place to ask.I will help you, for I have an extra copy.  We must aid each other, yes?  That is how we flourish.I require three items of power.  Bring them to me and I will give you the digest.I will not speak their names.  Ears may be on us.  But here, I will write them down."
736,"You need Yagyin's Digest?  Your plan, then, is to gather another flock?  Of course it is...and of course I will help you, <brother/sister>.But you must help me too.I require three items of power.  Bring me these and the digest will be yours.I cannot utter the names of these items, but I will write them down.Get me the items on this list.  If you can do that, then you are truly worthy of opening your own chapter of our order."
737,"I have the digest for you, <name>.  I need not tell you to take great care with it.  And to keep it far from unfriendly hands."
738,"Prospector Agmond was in charge of our excavation sites in the Badlands, to the southwest.  I say ""was"" because...well, I haven't heard from him in weeks.  I need you to find Agmond so I can get his report.Last I heard Agmond was at the southernmost dig site in the Badlands--a tiny operation past the Angor Fortress.  I'd start your search for him there."
739,"Agmond's tracks lead from the west.  It is easy to tell from the bloody smears across rock and sand that the dwarf crawled some distance.And here he died.Upon close inspection, the word ""Murdaloc"" is roughly scrawled in a patch of Badlands sandstone.Scrawled next to Agmond's dead hand."
741,"So the prospector wants to send the mysterious fossil to the Explorers' League in Darnassus? I don't feel right leaving Darkshore without him.Here, <name>, deliver the mysterious fossil to Chief Archaeologist Greywhisker in Darnassus."
742,"Attention, young adventurers!  The wilds of Ashenvale await you!The Horde has established a strong presence in the lands north of the Barrens.  Our two outposts - Splintertree Post and the Zoram Strand Outpost - strive to bring glory to the Horde!  Those who would prove themselves should seek out guidance there.  Of note: Senani Thunderheart in Splintertree Post, directly north of the Barrens, seeks adventurers willing to take part in a great hunt of Ashenvale!"
743,"Thank you for taking the time to speak to me, <name>. I am Ruul, warrior and teacher.You have obviously reached an age when you must prepare for your trials if you are to adventure much further out of Mulgore.If you wish a test of your strength, start by seeking out the Windfury harpies to the southeast. They nestle along the mountain's edges away from the road.They are one of our natural enemies here in Mulgore and will be a good gauge of your skill."
744,"<name>, my brother soon stands before Chief Bloodhoof, and it is my honor to make his headdress for him.I want to ask a favor of you while I finish tanning these leather straps. There is not time for me to find enough feathers, and I was wondering, would you gather more for me?You can find feathers of the correct size from the harpies residing far to the north and northwest of Thunder Bluff. I need only 6 azure and 6 bronze feathers to complete the design."
745,"<name>, there are many conflicts that wound this land. It is my hope that you will not bear witness to as many of them as I have. Yet there is one that I would ask you to seek out. It will give you some sense of how terrible, if left unchecked, even a small threat can be to the land.Palemane gnolls have settled to the south of Bloodhoof and in a cave to the west. They disrespect our attempts to communicate with them, and they slay the wildlife of Mulgore unbridled.Words are no longer the answer."
746,"There are dwarves preparing a dig site to the northwest.  They think secrets lie in the earth, and that is true, but hollowing and defiling the land is no way to earn its teachings.Collect the dwarven tools of digging, smash them, and return to me with the dwarves' broken tools.You can smash the tools at a forge.  You will find one in Thunder Bluff, but any forge -- even a forge at the dwarven camp -- will suffice."
747,"You have a promising air about you, and will prove yourself to the tribe. Perhaps someday soon you will be welcomed into the great city of Thunder Bluff. But before that can happen you must prove yourself to my father, Chief Hawkwind.Up here on Red Cloud Mesa we pride ourselves on keen hunting skills. Tauren hunt out of necessity and for sport. Our supply of meats has run low and we require feathers for clothing. Hunt the nearby plainstriders and prove yourself by resupplying the village."
748,"Goblins and their servants have tainted our sacred water wells!  We cannot allow this.To cleanse each well, I must create a cleansing totem, then you must bring the totem to the well and perform a cleansing ritual.First we will create a cleansing totem for the Winterhoof Water Well.  To do this, the land must offer its aid. Hunt prairie wolves for their paws and adult plainstriders for their talons.  They are to the southwest.Return to me with the paws and talons, <name>."
749,"A few days ago, we found a Venture Co. caravan traveling under guard on the northern shore of Stonebull Lake. We'd lost two of our number in an earlier battle, so we were quick to attack and lay waste to the caravan.We left their supply crates, thinking that our torches would destroy anything of value, but given that Venture Co. salvagers have been spotted near the burned wagons, maybe we were wrong.Perhaps you could go to the caravan and examine the contents of the crates."
750,A tauren skilled in the ways of the hunt knows that his prey is not for mere trophy. The beasts of the plains provide us with a means of survival. You will make quite an impression on the elders if you can bring back some highly valued Mountain Cougar Pelts. You can find the beasts lurking in the hills to the south.Our children need clothing and our tents need mending.
751,"Prying open the lid reveals a tightly packed assortment of ore and minerals, more evidence of the Venture Co.'s mining operation in Mulgore. On the top of the ore and minerals you remove a tightly bound sheaf of papers.Up in the foothills to the east, you can barely hear the sounds of work, and see smoke rising from a large fire."
752,All members of the tribe share in the harmony of life. We live together and work together.Our commitment to one another carries with it a high degree of responsibility. I ask of you now a humble task.My mother set out this morning to fetch water from the well to the southeast of Narache. It has been quite some time now. Perhaps you could check on her for me while I attend to tribal matters here?
753,"I have traveled many paths through life and these old legs lack the vigor they once had. I can still perform my duties to the tribe. Sometimes it just takes an old woman a little longer to do the task.But you look like an eager <class>. Let's put some of that youthful vitality to the test. Take a water pitcher from the well and bring it to my son, the Chief, in Camp Narache.Remember that even the most humble task can gain the recognition of elders."
754,"I have crafted the totem to cleanse the Winterhoof Water Well.  Now, you must take it to the well and perform a cleansing ritual.  You will find it to the southeast, guarded by foul goblins!This will not be an easy task, but you must do it if we are ever to use its waters again.Fortune to you, <name>."
755,"Your willingness to perform a humble task for the tauren of Narache and your eagerness to learn are noble traits, <name>. I believe one day you will be heralded in Thunder Bluff as a <class> of greatness.Before that you must embark on the Rites of the Earthmother, of which there are three.The first test is the Rite of Strength. Travel to Seer Graytongue and tell him Chief Hawkwind has sent you.You will find the seer's abode directly to the south of Camp Narache, tucked away in the hills."
756,"To create the Thunderhorn Cleansing Totem, you must gather the claws of the predators of the Mulgore plains.  Hunt prairie stalkers for their stalker claws and flatland cougars for their cougar claws, then return to me.You will find the prairie stalkers and flatland cougars to the east and west."
757,The Rites of the Earthmother are the steps a young tauren needs to take to gain respect in Thunder Bluff.First you must pass the Rite of Strength. In this test you must prove your bravery by slaying enemies of the tribe.Bristlebacks of Brambleblade Ravine to the east are encroaching on our tribal lands. They ambush our hunting parties and steal from the village by dark.Show your valor by slaying these villains and return to the Chief in Camp Narache with their belts as proof of your deeds.
758,"The totem is ready, <name>.  And again, it is your task to perform the ritual of cleansing.Go to the Thunderhorn Water Well, north of the village, and use the Thunderhorn Cleansing Totem in your ritual.  After you do this, return to me.May the spirits guide you."
759,"There is but one water well left to cleanse, named after the Wildmane clan.  For this well to be pure, the land must offer the teeth of a fierce predator, the prairie wolf alpha.  Find the alphas to the north, then return to me when your hunt is finished.Alphas often wander around the base of our mighty city, Thunder Bluff."
760,"Your cleansing of the Winterhoof and Thunderhorn wells is spoken among the spirits, young <name>.  The Wildmane Totem is made, and your last task lies ahead.The Wildmane Water Well lies north of Thunder Bluff.  Perform the ritual!  Heal the land of the goblins' poisons!  Let clean water flow once again!"
761,"The swoop is a cunning bird, and difficult to find and hunt.  A collection of Swoop Quills is a badge of cleverness and determination for a hunter.If you are willing to take up this task, then enter the plains and hunt the swoop.Bring me their quills, and bring honor to your clan.The swoops may be found anywhere in Mulgore, but your eyes must be sharp to spot them, and your hooves must be quick to catch them."
762,"Ambassador Infernus was sent to Angor Fortress by Ragnaros himself to mind the Shadowforge seeking lost artifacts in Uldaman.It has already meant tremendous casualties for our people, but it has obviously grown worse. I hesitate to guess how many artifacts they would be able to find and use against Ironforge.Our goal is simple, <class>. Return to the Badlands and destroy Ambassador Infernus. Once the threat is eliminated, return to Advisor Belgrum with proof of your victory.It is in your hands now."
763,"For you to continue with the Rites of the Earthmother you must pass two more tests. It is time for you to broaden your experience, <name>.Travel to Bloodhoof Village and seek out the Chief, Baine Bloodhoof, son of Cairne. There you may continue your journey and earn the acceptance of the elders of Thunder Bluff.Take this totem to Baine. He will recognize my carvings and help you on your path.Follow the road out of Camp Narache and travel with haste. Do not stray or you will lose your way."
764,"This explains the buildup of Venture Co. employees and equipment we've seen in Mulgore. Those goblins... their company is expanding too quickly for their own good. It's how they say, show a goblin something, and you can hear the scales in the background.Greedy little things, they are. Unfortunately for their business enterprise, we tauren cannot allow them to conduct their operations in our lands. Go to their mine northeast of the ravaged caravan and send them a message."
765,"According to the documents you salvaged from the caravan, the Venture Co. created many plans to attempt to drive us from our lands here, so that they could have free reign to plunder our lands.The depths that they would sink to accomplish their goals disgusts and appalls me. I want the mastermind behind their plans killed. His name is Supervisor Fizsprocket, you will find him at the Venture Co. mine east of the ravaged caravan. Bring me his clipboard, we shall see if we find out anything useful."
766,"My grandfather told me stories about his battles with a strider named Mazzranache. He told me of its demonic red eyes, razor-sharp talons and venomous bite.As fortune would have it, while traveling across the plains, I encountered it, and it took a nasty bite from my shoulder. He was as terrible as my grandfather described. I will need some hard-to-find animal parts to clean the infection from his bite: a wolf heart, cougar femur, plainstrider scale and swoop gizzard.Hurry, time is of the essence."
767,"The Rite of Vision, one of the Rites of the Earthmother, will help guide you toward earning the respect of the elders of Thunder Bluff.Our people have learned that the land is our most holy provider. In order to take part in the ritualistic vision, you must speak with the spiritual leader of the village, Zarlman Two-Moons."
768,"Greetings, young one.  You have a gleam in your eye; I can tell you are eager to venture back to the plains for the hunt.  May you bring honor to your clan!I work with the skins of beasts, fashioning them into clothes and armor for the people of Thunder Bluff.If you hunt beasts and bring me their skins, then I will fashion something for you."
769,"The kodo beasts of Mulgore are strong and sturdy -- traits much respected among us.  If you are skilled in leatherworking and wish the knowledge to make a Kodo Hide Bag, then bring me supplies for my trade.Do this, and I will share my knowledge with you."
770,"The ragged hide of Ghost Howl still bears a terrible wound, gained from the wolf's battles against the Burning Legion.Perhaps someone in Bloodhoof Village should know of Ghost Howl's demise...."
771,"In order to pass through the Rite of Vision, you must gather the reagents needed to make the Water of the Seers.I will need well stones, which can be found around the water wells in Mulgore. With those I will combine Ambercorn, which fall beneath the mighty trees in our land.These reagents contain magical elements, and when brewed and consumed before the tribal fire, will cause you to encounter a vision. Follow it, and it will lead you to the next step of this holy quest."
772,"I now present you with the Water of the Seers.When you are ready, consume the waters near the tribal fire. Once you have ingested the holy waters, it will take a few moments before the vision materializes before the fire.At that point, it is up to you to follow it to your destiny...."
773,"To gain acceptance amongst the elders of Thunder Bluff you must next complete the Rite of Wisdom.Now that you have passed the Rite of Vision, the ancestral spirits of Red Rocks will give you the blessing of our ancestors. Only those who have drunk from the Water of Seers can gain the blessing.Travel east of Thunder Bluff, to Red Rocks and seek out the Ancestral Spirit, <name>."
775,"You will now be revered within our great city. Any <race> worthy of completing the Rites of the Earthmother earns that honor.For your final quest, seek out our noble leader, Cairne Bloodhoof, who dwells atop the highest mesa in Thunder Bluff."
776,"You have passed the Rites of the Earthmother and earned your place in Thunder Bluff.But in order to maintain the spot that you strived so hard to achieve, you must continue to prove your worth to your people.We are hunters, <name>. Down below in Mulgore there is a mighty kodo named Arra'chea. Show me your skills in the ways of tracking and hunting by bringing me the Horn of Arra'chea."
777,"Okay, here you go.I'm going to be over here... behind cover.Feel free to join me."
778,"Haha! Done! The shackles are done!It's time, Lucien. It's time, Servo!Are you ready to bear witness to the perfect blend of alchemy, engineering, and the arcane, <name>?I shall summon forth a powerful elemental now. This is a groundbreaking day for all of us."
780,The Battleboars of Brambleblade Ravine to the east are encroaching on our tribal hunting grounds. They are trained to be malicious by the Bristleback Quilboars with whom we are at war.Go and slay the vile creatures and bring back some snouts and flanks so that we can make stew for our young.
781,"After carefully evaluating the map, you realize that what you discovered are the plans made by the Bristleback warchief for an extended siege on Camp Narache.Surely Chief Hawkwind could use this information!"
782,"From the Horde's alliance with the dragon Deathwing during the Second War, we know that two of his lieutenants, Blacklash and Hematus, were imprisoned within Lethlor Ravine far to the east. We must silence our depraved allies of old to restore honor to the Horde!We hired Tho'grun and his band of ogre mercenaries to help us obtain the Sign of the Earth, a key needed to unlock the drakes' prison. Tho'grun betrayed us though, overwhelming us and taking it for himself. Go to Camp Boff and take it back!"
783,"I hope you strapped your belt on tight, young <class>, because there is work to do here in Northshire.And I don't mean farming.The Stormwind guards are hard pressed to keep the peace here, with so many of us in distant lands and so many threats pressing close.  And so we're enlisting the aid of anyone willing to defend their home.  And their alliance.If you're here to answer the call, then speak with my superior, Marshal McBride.  He's inside the abbey behind me."
784,"Led by Admiral Proudmoore, the humans of Kul Tiras encroached on Durotar, violating the Warchief's pact made with Jaina Proudmoore in order to defeat Archimonde years ago.The human aggression was repelled and Tiragarde Keep fell. But recently, the Admiral's reserves, led by Lieutenant Benedict, have retaken the keep and once again pose a threat to our homeland. These humans show no respect for diplomacy.Prove your honor and travel south to Tiragarde Keep to eliminate the human invaders."
786,"Lower your voice, <class>. The Kolkar centaurs lie just over the ridge to the west in Kolkar Crag.Last night while they were raiding, I snuck into their village and discovered that the dirty beasts have a three-tiered attack planned on the trolls and orcs of Durotar.We mustn't let their invasion come to fruition. Perhaps you can muster the might needed to infiltrate Kolkar Crag and destroy their attack plans.Last I saw, they had divided them up amongst three of their leaders."
787,"Throm'ka, <class>. I am Eitrigg, charged by Thrall to oversee the training of recruits.The Horde has changed from what it once was. There was a time where I left the Horde, disillusioned by the growing influence of the power-hungry pawns of the Burning Legion. During my exile, I was taken prisoner by a group of humans, but was rescued by the Warchief. Hearing his vision of the Horde free of demonic influence, guided by the shamans, I returned.Gornek will have further instructions for you."
788,"The first order of business will be to put a little strength in your backbone. I could send you out to the Barrens to hunt kodo, but well, in all honesty, you're more useful to us alive than dead.I believe you would find a good match with the mottled boars you'll find to the north of here."
789,"Powerful warrior and awkward novice alike have fallen to the venomous sting of the scorpid. You will find large numbers of scorpids northwest of here. Bring me ten of their tails as proof of your prowess in battle.The antidote for their sting is actually made from venom extracted from their stingers. We keep large quantities of antidote for scorpid venom on hand to heal young bloods just like you...But I'm sure you won't be needing any of that, will you?"
790,"<class>! I thought I would die out here with none to know of it. While I was hunting the scorpids of the Valley, I came across a particularly vicious-looking one. Hurling myself at it, I managed to inflict a massive blow to its claw before it closed around my leg.I wasn't ready for its stinger though, and it sliced down and into my chest, cutting into my flesh and letting my blood. Please, you must kill the scorpid for me! My honor must be upheld! I fought it up on the plateau to the south."
791,"Age has rendered me useless in battle. Now I make myself useful in other ways.From this vantage point I watch for invaders. As our strength here grows, I find myself blowing the signal horn less and less.To pass the time I fashion goods to help younger, more able warriors defend our homeland.For you, I can fashion you a bag for your belongings. If such an item would be of use to you, bring me some canvas, a material common to the humans and centaurs."
792,"I trust the Valley of Trials will teach you much, young <class>.I was sent to the Valley to guide you, but I have discovered a growing taint here...A group that calls itself the Burning Blade has a coven here in the Valley of Trials.  They are skulking in a cave to the northeast, and their Vile Familiars have spilled from its mouth to cause havoc.As your first task against the Burning Blade, I bid you, defeat these familiars. Slay many and, if you survive, return to me."
793,"The Seal of the Earth is held by three runestones, held in the Pillars of Diamond, Opal, and Amethyst in Lethlor Ravine. Using the Sign of the Earth, you will be able to remove the runestones and unlock the Seal of the Earth.Be wary though, <name>, the black drakes Blacklash and Hematus are not to be trifled with. See them dead and return their bindings to me.To reach the ravine, travel to the far eastern part of the Badlands.  Be careful though, for the ravine is home to countless drakes."
794,"Through my divinations, I see that an item of power hides deep within the Burning Blade Coven, guarded by beasts and black magic.It is called the Burning Blade Medallion, and your next task is to find it and remove it from the coven.But be wary, for the medallion may be possessed by an agent of the Burning Blade, and if so then the agent's power would be greater than the familiars you have already encountered.Go, <name>.  You will find the coven in a cave, to the north and west."
804,"Seeing the deed you have done for me steels my heart. I cannot fall so easily! I must endure!But it remains that I cannot make the trek back to the Den unassisted. Please, <name>, return to the Den and tell Gornek of my situation. Perhaps he can help me."
805,"Your trials against the Burning Blade are finished... here in the Valley.  But I want you to report your findings.Go to the troll village of Sen'jin and seek out Master Gadrin.  Sen'jin Village is east out of the valley, then right at the fork.Tell Gadrin of the Burning Blade, and that they have reached the Valley of Trials.  Discover from him if they have yet reached Sen'jin.Go, <name>, and be swift.  I fear the evil found in the Burning Blade Coven is but the herald of a larger threat..."
806,"We cannot allow the Burning Blade a foothold in Durotar!  We must destroy them before their evil festers!I have undergone my own investigations and found that a Burning Blade warlock, the goblin Fizzle Darkstorm, has camped within Thunder Ridge to the northwest.  There he and his cultist minions spread chaos.Find and defeat Fizzle, and bring me his dead claw!"
808,"I hear the voice of my brother, Minshina, calling to me in my dreams.He was taken by Zalazane, the warlock on the Echo Isles to the east. And he is dead.But death is not freedom for my brother. Minshina's spirit was trapped within his own skull by Zalazane's magics. In my dreams I see it with other skulls, in a circle of power on the largest Echo Isle. As long as it remains there my brother's soul is doomed.Please, <name>. Find the circle and retrieve Minshina's skull. Bring it to me.Free him!"
809,"Since the last great war when the Burning Legion was defeated, I have searched for sources of demonic corruption in orc society.  The collar you brought me confirms my fears.It belongs to the Burning Blade, a cult that rallies around an item of demonic power.  It is called the Demon Seed, and it resides in the Barrens atop Dreadmist Peak.  It must be destroyed!Go to Far Watch Post, on the border of the Barrens to the west, and speak with my assistant, Ak'Zeloth.  He will direct you further."
812,"<name>... your timing is perfect. I just hope I can compliment your haste as well.I was careless while fighting a few of the venomtails nearby, and one of them stung me deeply. I can feel its poison weakening me even as we speak. At this rate, I got maybe an hour left to live. But I'll need your help if I'm to do so...Kor'ghan in Orgrimmar knows how to make the antidote. Find him... and hurry, <name>. I won't be able to last much longer. He should be in the Cleft of Shadow."
813,"Venomtails are some of the deadliest scorpids in Durotar. It was unwise for Rhinag to hunt them without having some of the antidote with him, but right now, chastising is the last thing he needs.Bring me a few venomtail poison sacs from any of the venomtails near the entrance of Orgrimmar and I'll make an antidote for him.Make haste, <name>. One of our own needs your help."
815,"Bah! I almost forgot I need to get breakfast ready.<name>, get yourself movin' and get me some taillasher eggs. I'll need at least three of them if I'm going to have enough for tomorrow's meal.The Bloodtalon taillashers can be fierce, and protect their eggs to the death more often than not. They sometimes bury their eggs too deep in the earth to uncover safely, but if you head to the Echo Isles to the southeast of Sen'jin Village, you can usually find them all over those islands."
816,"<name>, please, can you help me? My son Kron went hunting days ago, and he still hasn't returned. He went west towards the Barrens to hunt crocolisks along Southfury River. I fear the worst.As strong as he was, his stubborn pride has always drawn him into trouble. I warned him that the crocolisks were powerful and vicious. He grew angry and stormed off.If you can't find him, at least bring me a sign of his fate... even if you have to open up the stomach of every crocolisk along the Southfury's banks."
817,"Many of the hides we use come from Durotar tigers, <name>. Blankets, armor, tents: there are a great many reasons we hunt the beasts, and many reasons we let them thrive at the same time.The time has come for us to cull the flock, so to speak. Our numbers grow, and our needs are beginning to overwhelm our stocks. I need more hides if I'm to prepare suitable goods for our people.Bring me 4 Durotar tiger furs, and I shall reward you. You can find them on the islands south of here."
818,"Although my eyes fail me, I still can see clearly enough. More often I must rely on my alchemical skills to aid me in magics that once came easily. But I refuse to take on an apprentice--no troll or orc worthy enough has ever come forward.Are you worthy? Yes, of course you are... of course you think you are.I need a few things. Will you get them for me?I need intact makrura eyes, and vials of crawler mucus. You can find them on any makrura or crawler in Durotar. We shall speak again soon."
819,"A small placard on one of the ends of the keg says,""Chen Stormstout-May your spirit be raised and always raise your spirits."""
821,"Would you like a taste of Chen's namesake? Ahh, the stormstout is a mighty brew. Chen taught the recipe to my mentor, and my mentor passed it on to me. I'll need you to get me a few things, but I can tell you this: the kick is worth it.Bring me 5 savannah lion tusks from any savannah lion, 5 plainstrider kidneys from any plainstrider, and 1 thunder lizard horn from any species of thunder lizard. That should do the trick nicely.You can find these ingredients throughout the Barrens."
822,"Good stuff, that stormstout, huh?I have another recipe that I learned from Chen. Would you be interested? It won't take long to make, and it might be useful if you plan on adventuring some more.Bring me 5 lightning glands from any stormhide, 1 thunderhawk saliva gland from greater thunderhawks, and a kodo liver from any of the Barrens' kodos.Like I said, this stuff has kick; it's the trogg ale that I mentioned to you before."
823,"We at Sen'jin Village are not without our own troubles, and we thank you for your aid.  But the news you bring regarding the Burning Blade could be trouble for everyone.There is an orc stationed at Razor Hill, Orgnil Soulscar, who polices Durotar from evils such as the Burning Blade!  Go to Orgnil and tell him of our plight, as well as your news from the Valley of Trials.  He will want to know these things.Razor Hill lies to the north."
824,"The Earthen Ring is a shamanistic group dedicated to studying and preserving the elements.  They have forgotten more about crazy old gods, ancient legends and lore than most scholars will ever know.Lucky for you, I know someone in the Earthen Ring here in Ashenvale.  Head over to Zoram'gar Outpost on the coast of the Zoram Strand; show Je'neu Sancrea what you found.  If anyone can figure out that globe's significance, it'd be him."
825,"One of my most observant scouts brings back word that the wreckage of Proudmoore's fleet still remains off the coast of Durotar, just east of Tiragarde Keep.It is no secret that the humans, in alliance with those foul little creatures known as gnomes, have an advanced knowledge of mechanics. We must have a complete understanding of all our potential enemies. And our people will benefit from this new knowledge as well.Swim through the wreckage, <name>, and retrieve for me the tools of the Alliance."
826,"The witchdoctor Zalazane dwells on the Echo Isles to the east.  They are the isles we once called home.From there he sends his trolls to the mainland, to hex our people and drag more of them under his sway.He must be stopped.Defeat Zalazane and his minions -- former Darkspear trolls, now lost to us.  Bring me his head and I will know his reign of evil is over."
827,"<name>.  The Burning Blade has infested the cave east of Orgrimmar known as Skull Rock.  Inside that cave they perform vile rituals, and burn their own flesh with Searing Collars.By wearing these collars, I believe the cultists attune themselves to demonic power.  But to confirm this, I must have a collection of the collars to study.Go to Skull Rock and gather Searing Collars from the cultists you find there.  Bring them to me, and I will uncover their secrets."
828,"One of our Shamans, Margoz, knows more of the Burning Blade's corruption.  He speaks of a cave called Skull Rock in the mountains - just outside Orgrimmar! - that shelters a large band of Burning Blade cultists.Before you go to Skull Rock speak with Margoz.  He is wise and his council is valued.He is camped to the northeast, between the coast and Drygulch Ravine.Follow his advice, but whatever Margoz says, <name>, I still want you to crush those cultists!"
829,"The Searing Collars you brought me are powerful, demonic implements.  Divining their origin is, I'm afraid, beyond my skills as a shaman.  We will need a warlock to study them.Take a searing collar to Neeru Fireblade.  Although he is a skilled warlock, he professes to use his powers to thwart demons, and claims his research in the occult is benign.  Be that true or false, we may need his aid against the demonic cult in Durotar.You may find Neeru in Orgrimmar in the Cleft of Shadow."
830,"You open the aged and weathered envelope and discover an official looking document. You recognize the seal of Admiral Proudmoore.This looks important. Perhaps Gar'Thok, the commander of Razor Hill, would be interested in having this information."
831,"Humans cannot be trusted. We fought alongside them with a weary heart, knowing they would betray us one day.Admiral Proudmoore's death was not enough to stop his legacy of deceit. The human scum had his plans well laid out before he ever met his demise.His reign won't even die with Benedict it seems. Who knows how long it will be before the next waves of Proudmoore's men land upon our shores.We need to get these orders to Nazgrel in Orgrimmar immediately! He can be found in Thrall's chamber."
832,"<Words emanate from the pendant and into your mind.>Gazz'uz?Gazz'uz...report!There is word of your discovery in Skull Rock.  You must prepare for an attack!Gazz'uz, I order you to speak!  Speak or I will make sure Neeru Fireblade knows of your presence, and he will descend on you with swift brutality.Do not test your skills against Neeru......Gazz'uz, are you there...?"
833,"Only the most valiant tauren are laid to rest at Red Rocks, our sacred burial ground. It is an honor bestowed upon the great warriors who helped found and defend Thunder Bluff and those who have given their lives for the greater good of their tribes and chieftains.But it appears a foul menace has made its way onto our holy land. A band of Bristleback Interlopers is ravaging the grave site and I am too old and past my prime to drive them away.They must be driven off with force, <name>."
834,"I'm Rezlak, one of Gazlowe's boys. Boss sent me to help the orcs here in Durotar. Things'd been going good except for the caravans. Can't manage to keep them safe! Makes my job a little harder, you know?The last shipment--they promised it'd get through!--was snatched by the Dustwind harpies of...where was it...Razorwind Canyon?I gotta have those supplies or I'll never get anything done! Follow the big canyon to the south, you'll find the ravine cut right into the west and east sides of the walls."
835,"Gazlowe told me once, ""Rezlak. There's one thing you need to know in life, and that's if you want something done well, do it yourself.""I can't deal with losing all our caravans, so I'm just going to take matters into my own hands. Drygulch Ravine lies through the eastern part of Razorwind Canyon. If we kill all the harpies there, the routes will be safe.Of course, there was one other thing that Gazlowe taught me, and that's ""You can get anything done for a price."" So, going to help me out, <name>?"
836,"The gnome's voice crackles once again from the robot:""I need to move OOX-09/HL to an open, safe place so it can begin a lengthy take-off procedure.  It has built-in cloaking, but I need time on my end to make it operational again.  Escort the robot from its current location to, let's say, the shoreline beyond Overlook Cliff!  That should be a perfect place, and long enough, to get things online!""""Escort it safely to the shore, and then come talk to me in Booty Bay!  Oglethorpe Obnoticus - out!"""
837,"When we arrived, the Razormane quilboars possessed much of the land, and proved a thorn in our sides. Through our efforts we have driven out the largest part of their numbers, but still they remain well-fortified in some areas.It has gone on long enough, however. For our own protection, we cannot allow the Razormane any hold in our lands. Their camps can be found to the west of here. Look for the brambles and you will find them. Today we drive them from Durotar, tomorrow, perhaps from all of Kalimdor."
838,"On the island of Caer Darrow lies Scholomance - a school that serves as a stronghold for the Scourge.  Our enemy dwells within, safely allowed to pursue research that strengthens their power.  A door bars the way, and try as we might no entry is to be had without a proper key.Apothecary Dithers is well versed on Scholomance, and has an idea how to obtain a key.  You have proved your value to me as someone who can get things done; I now entrust this task to you.  Speak with him on this matter."
840,"Hmm, you look pretty strong.Listen, my good friend Kargal needs some new recruits for Barrens duty. I know you want to do what's right for the Horde. Well, this is your chance.Take this recruitment letter to Kargal and see if he'll sign it."
841,"Let me guess - you didn't get whatever world-ending, nefarious deed you were doing done in time.  No wait, better still... you dropped it in the sand!  Well, whatever the reason, I do have additional power sources I will sell to you.  This time, however, it will cost you ten, YES TEN Wastewander Water Pouches!Times are tough all around, <name>, and power sources don't grow on trees!  Hrm, but what if they did.  Maybe we could MAKE a power source tree..."
842,"Take this signed recruitment letter to the Crossroads.Sergra Darkthorn, curse her hide, is in charge there. She's a nasty shaman who will talk your head in circles before she lets you do anything useful. Thrall is convinced she's something special, but I'm not so sure.You'll just have to decide for yourself, pup..."
843,"In solitude I wander these roads.The dwarves of Bael Modan show no respect for my land. Horrendous blasts drive holes deep into the ground as noisy machines rip apart the hills. Lands which once served as home and provider to my tribe are now riddled with destructive dwarves.Attempts at reaching a diplomatic resolution have failed. Now is the time for decisive action.Drive the dwarves from the Bael Modan excavation by force and bring to me the journal of their leader, Prospector Khazgorm."
844,Your first prey will be easy.The plainstriders to the east have been harassing our food supplies and have become a nuisance.Put down the plainstriders and return to me with their beaks.
845,"The zhevra, although not the fiercest beast in the Barrens, are a shade tougher than the plainstriders.  Don't worry -- we'll send you against bigger prey in good time, but for now your teeth could use a little more cutting.Hunt the zhevra to the north and south, and collect their hooves.  Bring them to me and perhaps we'll next send you against something tougher."
846,"It is clear the prospector depended on explosives and those noisy vehicles to rip the ground apart. We can expect a new foreman to take over soon.I want to give the dwarves a taste of their own medicine. According to these plans if we combine nitroglycerin with wood pulp and sodium nitrate we can create an explosive charge. The rifleman, soldiers and officers in the Keep are known to have the supplies.Collect these items and bring them to me. I will fashion a charge that the dwarves won't forget!"
847,"This... this power.... Is this the power of the shamans that Tor'gan tried to show me? I must say, it is interesting. Tell Tor'gan that he has convinced me... for the time being. I will listen to what he has to say."
848,"The oases of the Barrens hide a mystery.  Life energy flows from their waters, invigorating the plants and beasts that drink it.Invigorating, and altering.There is a mushroom that grows near these oases.  Its spores hold properties that we, the apothecaries of Lordaeron, find useful.Bring me these spores and you will earn our gratitude."
849,"Following Khazgorm's plans it should be no problem to fashion an explosive chargeAh, there we go.Now, <name>, I am going to entrust you with a special task. Take this explosive stick and use it to blow up the flying machine at Bael Modan.Not only is the flying machine a key part of the site's infrastructure it also serves as a weapon of war. More importantly it is an icon of power and an insult to the memory of my tribe.Make me proud by completing this heroic task and you shall be rewarded."
850,"The centaurs have plagued the Tauren for years.  And recently, the Kolkar centaurs of the Barrens have grown into a real threat.  Normally they were disorganized in these lands, but new leaders have risen among them.  Rallying them.To preserve our holdings here, these centaur leaders must be destroyed.Bring me the head of Barak Kodobane.  He camps near the Forgotten Pools to the north.Defeat him, then return to me."
851,"The centaur Verog the Dervish wanders the Barrens, and will be difficult to find.  But he is based at the centaur command tent at the Stagnant Oasis to the southeast.  It may be possible to draw him to you.Travel to the Stagnant Oasis to the southeast and attack centaur near the command tent.  It will be dangerous, but if you can kill enough centaur then they should raise an alarm.  And Verog will come.Bring me his head and I will place it with Barak Kodobane's."
852,"Hezrul Bloodmark is the leader of the Kolkar centaurs in the Barrens.  He is fierce, brutal and cunning.  Defeating him would disrupt and fracture the Kolkars, greatly reducing their threat to us.So kill him.  As with Barak and Verog, bring me Hezrul's Head.He leads his people from the Lushwater Oasis, to the south."
853,"I have rendered the spores you gave me into an emulsion.  I must now send it to my associate, Apothecary Zamah.  If you were to carry this to her, she can offer you something from our stores of alchemical goods.She is in the Pools of Vision, a cave beneath the shamans of Thunder Bluff.  The path to this cave is well hidden, but you may find it on the Spirit Rise bluff.Do hurry.  This emulsion will maintain its potency for only a short time, and must be resealed and processed before then."
854,"I have foreseen your arrival, young <class>. Though perhaps you are not so young anymore.I think that it is time for you to move deeper into this land. I can sense that you are destined for great things.It is the Crossroads that you must seek out, for our lives with the orcs have become intertwined and they need assistance. Continue down this road towards the east and follow it north to the Crossroads. Find Thork within its walls, he has the Earthmother's blessing."
855,"The Kolkar are a threat to the Horde's claims in the Barrens; we must reduce the numbers of their troops.  And so, I have a bounty task for you.While in Kolkar territories, slay their warriors and collect centaur bracers.  Return when you have a heap of bracers and the Horde will reward you well."
857,"The power was mine! In my very hands! And I want it back! Back I say!Those dirty excavators uncovered it... so beautiful it was. Deemed the Tear of the Moons, it was the first great discovery we made at Bael Modan.It should have been mine! Mine I say!General Twinbraid grew jealous of the power it gave me. He locked it away in the Keep. Called it cursed, he did! The fool!Others wanted it and they had to be stopped! That bastard Twinbraid drove me off.Now I want it back. Back I say!"
858,"I don't suppose Sputtervalve sent you? I'm in a bind here. I hopped in without realizing that I need a key to unlock the shredder's movement column. One of the other shredder operators asked me if everything was okay, and I panicked! Instead of telling him that I was missing my key, I told him there was some sort of mechanical problem.We need to get out of here on the double! Go up to the control room at the top of the derrick, the supervisor should have a key for this shredder.Help me out here!"
860,"If you wish to walk the hunter's path, then your journey leads to the Barrens.  Its beasts are strong-willed and fierce.  You will learn much by hunting there, and your spirit will grow.Speak with Sergra Darkthorn.  She will be your first guide in the Barrens.Sergra is at the Crossroads.  To reach her, travel east from Bloodhoof Village into the Barrens, then north as the road forks.  And have care as you travel--the Barrens holds great danger for the unprepared and unwary."
861,"You are eager to explore, I can tell.  I too had the lust to wander, once...Wander, and hunt.  For hunting is a Tauren's greatest honor.If you truly wish to follow the ways of the hunter, then Melor Stonehoof can show you the path.  He is in Thunder Bluff, on the Hunter's Rise.And to show him your skill and resolve, bring him the claws of the flatland prowlers of Mulgore.  They are tough and cunning -- fitting prey for a young <class> on the hunter's path."
862,"A <class> like you must get pretty hungry out here in The Barrens. Me, I'm starving all day long.Tell you what, I'll fix you up a nice stew. Just need a few dig rats.Seems those filthy dwarves at Bael Modan are overrun with everyone's favorite feast. Now head on down south to Bael Modan and bring me back some dig rats.You can't call yourself a seasoned adventurer until you've spent some time killing rats! Haw!"
863,"I suppose I'll learn as we go... Couldn't be too hard. Just some buttons here, and a lever or two... Well, are you ready to go?"
864,"""Here you go, the power source is safely removed and the data is preserved.  Well, safe journeys and all that.  Hope the nefarious science experiment worked out for you and all.""The goblin turns away from you to attend to the demands of the Gadgetzan Water Company.  You secure the sealed testing kit for the journey back to the Undercity.  Apothecary Zinge waits for you and the sealed field testing kit there."
865,"The raptors of the Barrens are smarter than raptors in other lands.  And I think all that smarts is hiding in their horns!  If so, then I could grind their horns into powder and use it to make ""smart drinks.""  I could sell them for a fortune!!!And you can help me.  Find me intact raptor horns from sunscale scytheclaws.  They roam in the southern Barrens, and in the northern Barrens near the border of Ashenvale Forest."
866,"The herbs of the Barrens are not quite like herbs in other lands.  Their properties are mostly the same, but the oasis water here alters the plants; they are just slightly different.I want to study those differences... to see if they're exploitable!If you are skilled in herbalism, then gather root samples off the herbs you find in the Barrens.  Bring back these samples so that I may compare them with herbs from other regions."
867,"The blasted harpies have been ravaging our caravan supplies for too long. It's time we slit a few of their throats and diminished their numbers.I've been snooping around their nests and figured out who leads who. The most devastating attack will destroy a good section of their lower chain of command and then we can work our way to the top.I'll start you off slow, take out Witchwing Harpies and Witchwing Roguefeathers in the Northwest and bring me 8 Witchwing talons. That should be a good start..."
868,"Hey, <name>. I been sent to the Crossroads to watch over the land and take note of its happenings for my masters in Orgrimmar.One object of my studies are the insect-like creatures found to the south in the Field of Giants. We know little of the creatures, so I be makin' it a point to discover more. They seem to have intelligence to them, more so than any normal animal.Take this digging claw and collect some of the creatures' eggs from their mounds, but be careful: if alerted, they will attack you."
869,"Not long ago, a shipment of silver was stolen from our guard tower.  It was meant as payroll to the Crossroads' guards, and we want that silver back.The strange thing is... we caught one of the thieves on the night of the theft.  And... it was a raptor!  Unbelievable!I don't know what raptors would want with silver.  But I don't care -- I want the raptors dead so they won't steal from us again!Hunt raptors in the Barrens.  Collect for me their heads!"
870,"Long ago, the Barrens was a lush place, teeming with life.  But war and cataclysm raged across the land, scorching it and leaving a dry husk.  Such is the way of things, and it saddens my heart.But within the past few years, new oases have formed in the Barrens, and life stirs.  And deep down, we druids sense a power leaking its way to the surface.We must find its source.  Travel to the Forgotten Pools, northwest of the Crossroads.  Search its waters for a source of power, then return here."
871,"All the quilboars are our enemies, <name>. Some just prove to be more of a nuisance than others.The Razormane tribe has been attacking our supply lines from Durotar, causing us no end of annoyance. I have scouts seeking the leader of these raids, but until then, any losses you can inflict on the filthy pig men would aid us.Start in the northeast towards Durotar. You can always tell their dens from the huge thorny vines that come up from the earth. Seek them out, and slay them."
872,"One of my scouts witnessed an attack on a caravan from Durotar, <name>. The culprits are indeed the Razormane tribe of quilboars. One of the quilboars in particular is leading the raids: Kreenig Snarlsnout. He was seen northeast of here, just south of the road from Durotar. If the threat is to be ended, then Kreenig must die.To be sure the attacks cease, though, I say we add insult to their injury. Kill Kreenig along with more of their tribe, and return to me when you have his tusk."
873,"The grand Isha Awak is lord of these waters.  Great is his strength, and solemn his pride.  The humans on the coast fear him, for he has consumed many of their number.But I do not fear him.  I am grateful he is here.  He is a worthy challenge, and honorable prey.If you are ready, then swim out and search for Isha Awak, the Deep Doom.His spirit dwells in his heart, and to hear its beat is to know your fate."
874,"You have hunted the beasts of the Barrens.  Your spirit is strong.  But a hunter must always be prepared.  A true hunter can stalk prey down any path.  Mountains and swamps will not sway <him/her>.Not even the sea.Find my sister, Mahren.  She hunts the great water beasts along the coast.  She will be your teacher in their ways.But be wary in your search for her, for the Barrens' coast is held by humans."
875,"Hahaha, <name>. Back for more? Good, I like to hear that.This time I want you to assassinate some of the harpy lieutenants in the Dry Hills. Only Witchwing Slayers can be lieutenants, and you can tell them apart by the rings they carry. They are a nasty bunch, but they lead some of the underlings in that area. Taking out 6 of them will be a decisive strike against their matriarchy.Make sure they die painfully, <name>. We want those harpy wenches to know the idiocy of picking fights with the Horde."
876,"You did so well with the lieutenants and underlings that I'd like you to do one last thing for me.Serena Bloodfeather is the sister of a harpy named Bloodfeather who was slain by Rexxar quite a while ago. Apparently, these attacks on the Horde caravans are revenge for her sister's death.I need you to slit her throat and bring me back her head. I want to place it on the next caravan we send out... Give those harpies something to think about."
877,"Like the one you found at the Forgotten Pools, there may be fissures at the other oases in the Barrens.  If so, then perhaps the fissures are the oases' source of life.We must test this.Here, take these seeds.  They are dead and infertile, but take them to the Stagnant Oasis to the southeast.  If there is a fissure there, then place the seeds within it...and observe."
878,"You must strike my enemies. <snort> You must help Mangletooth and the Razormane by weakening the Bristlebacks. Both tribes are very spiritual--tied to the earth and its power. <snort> It gives us strength in all things... especially war.If you want to find out who really causes Thork <snort> and the Horde such anguish, then help Mangletooth! You attack the spiritual leaders of the Bristlebacks to the north; weaken them so the Razormanes can defeat them and rule the Barrens."
879,"Three of my tribe came out of the Kraul to lead the raids against the Horde, <race>. <snort> They are ruthless and cunning, and if you defeat them, then your Crossroads and even most of the Barrens will learn peace... <snort> at least from the Razormane tribe. <snort>Nak, Kuz, and Lok Orcbane are the ones you seek. They are far to the south  of the Barrens. One is a spell caster, another a tracker, and their leader, the one called Orcbane, <snort> a warrior. Kill them, <race>, like they have killed me."
880,"Your findings are incredible, <name>.  These oases hold properties that must come from an outside source.  Or perhaps an inside one.I want to know how these fissures are affecting the beasts who drink from the oases' water.Hunt oasis snapjaws at the Lushwater and Stagnant Oases.  Bring me their shells so I may examine them."
881,"Whitemist, Echeyakee in the Tauren tongue, is the king of the savannah cats.  He hunts with such stealth, they say he's like a thin, white mist on the earth.  And he kills so fast his prey have no time for fear, or pain.The Tauren say he is both mercy and death.You will learn if that's true, for I now set you on the path to hunt Echeyakee.  His lair is northeast of the Crossroads, among the bones of giant KodoGo.  Blow this horn when you reach his lair.  Blow the horn, and he will come."
882,"Ishamuhale, Speartooth, is the fiercest sunscale raptor of the Barrens.  He does not hunt for sport, nor for food.  He hunts because hunting is his passion.  He kills because it is his nature to kill.And you will learn of his nature, <name>, for your path now follows the taloned tracks of Ishamuhale.Begin the hunt.  Slay his favorite prey, a zhevra, then bring its carcass to the dead tree northwest of Ratchet.  Ishamuhale will smell the carcass and be drawn to it.Be ready when he comes."
883,The Hoof of Lakota'mani is a symbol of the strength of the great kodo.
884,"When touched, sparks fly from the tailspike of Owatanka."
885,The feather of Washte Pawne is painful to the touch.
886,"The druids of Thunder Bluff sense a strange power leaking into the Barrens, east of Mulgore.Tonga Runetotem was sent to discover the source of this power, but we fear he will need aid.Travel to the Barrens and speak with Tonga.  He will be at the Crossroads.  To reach there, take the road east out of Bloodhoof village.  Enter the Barrens, then turn north when the road forks.  Continue north and  you will find the Crossroads.And do not leave the road, <name>, for the Barrens is a harsh land."
887,"I sure wish Vice Admiral Grezzlik did a better job of keeping the seas safe for our trading vessels. With all the gold the trade princes have poured into the Trade Fleets, it ticks me off to see so many pirates running willy-nilly, raiding my ships and stealing my goods!I heard that the Southsea Freebooters have set up a camp just south of here. They've been a real thorn in my side and if Grezzlik won't take care of them, well, maybe you can help me get rid of them."
888,"While I'd like to recover all my goods, I'm sure that's not possible. Still, there's a few things that I absolutely must have!As you see, my observatory is ready to go, but it needs the smaller of the two lenses. The first arrived by caravan from Durotar, but the second was bound by ship, and never arrived. Also, I never got my boot shipment from Drizzlik in Booty Bay!Head down to the pirate camp and see if you can find them."
890,"I've been waiting forever for my last shipment of goods from Booty Bay! I'm pretty sure that it must have been stolen by the Freebooters, but just to make sure, will you go down to the dockside and ask Dizzywig if my goods were already put into my warehouse without my knowledge?Here, take my ledger down to Dizzywig and have him double check my inventory records against his logs."
891,"Yet another ship from my fleet has been lost to those overzealous humans at Northwatch Hold!Those bastards must be dealt with. Their paranoia has them in a state of frenzy. Trigger happy, reckless louts are shooting at anything in their sights.Travel south along the Merchant Coast to the Hold and lay siege to their forces. Bring me the medals of their soldiers as proof. And for the love of my fleet, slay Captain Fairmount and her overzealous cannoneers!"
892,"Everything looks square from my records, <name>. Go on back and tell Gazlowe he's out of luck. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the pirates that nabbed his goodies.Nothing else I can do for him. Oh... though you could tell him that I've got some things from Undermine for him, when he has the time to come pick them up."
893,"The Razormane quilboars to the south, beyond the Field of Giants, have no skilled blacksmiths from what I am told, but they've apparently started to develop sturdier weapons. I'd like to get my hands on a few different types to learn their techniques if possible.If you wish to help bring honor to the Horde, then bring me examples of their weapons. Find me a dagger from their stalkers, a wand from their seers, and a shield from their warfrenzy. That should do nicely!"
894,"The Venture Company set up a small research facility far to the north of here, southwest of the Sludge Fen. I don't know very much about what they're doing, but did manage to discover that they're experimenting with something called a ""samophlange"".Now what the heck is a samophlange? Well, whatever it is, I want to examine it, so I need someone to go get it.I obtained a copy of their control system operating manual, you should be able to figure out how to disengage the samophlange from it."
895,"WANTED!Baron Longshore, Captain of the HeedlessCaptain Longshore of Gilneas leads vessels of the Southsea Freebooters, and is wanted on charges of piracy. Remains must be in identifiable condition!-- Gazlowe"
896,"Being Wharfmaster of a busy port like Ratchet, I keep my finger on the pulse of information. I know all about the exchange of goods and money between here and Booty Bay.The latest bit of news I've heard is about the Venture Company's Boulder Lode mine northeast of the Sludge Fen. One of the miners discovered an emerald the size of your fist. I know a few buyers who'd be interested in getting their hands on something like that, and I'd be willing to go half and half on its sale."
897,"This strange, insect-like creature looks outside of the natural order, as though it does not belong in the Barrens."
898,"Finally! Someone to rescue me!I can't believe you got past the guards. These zealots from Theramore are out of their minds. They sank our ship and imprisoned me, the only survivor. I was called an enemy and threat to the Alliance.Me! A threat to their great sham of an Alliance? I was a deckhand on a moonshine transport between Ratchet and Booty Bay.Enough talk. Help me get back to Ratchet will you? Let me know when you're ready and we'll make our break."
899,"Perhaps you know the pain of uncertainty, perhaps not, <class>. But know this: I stand here every day, from the sun's rising till its decline, scouring the horizon for more of those monsters. I've killed every pig man I've come across since, but my thirst for their blood is far from quenched. Perhaps instead of heading north to the Crossroads I should have headed to Taurajo.You, <class>--you  could help me.Kill them. Kill as many as you can. Bring me their tusks, and we will celebrate their deaths together."
900,The three control valves are currently opened. The various readings on the control panel lead you to presume that they must be shut off before the apparatus can be shut off.
901,"With the apparatus deactivated, the control panel can be opened up and the samophlange removed from the console. With everything else in place, all that is left is to acquire the key to unlock the console."
902,"Pulling open the face of the control console reveals a dense jumble of wires, tubing and other strange mechanical objects--most of which seem to serve no practical purpose. Pushing them aside and digging deeper into the console, you find the samophlange. A tug removes it from its housing."
903,"Now it's time to go after something that really bites.  The prowlers of the Barrens are a tough breed.  Tough, resourceful, sly... and deadly.  You'll find them among the tall grasses.  You'll find many to the southwest of the Crossroads.Be wary as you hunt them, <name>, or you may find yourself no longer the predator, but instead the prey."
905,"Now, <name>, the hunt deepens.  Now you must defeat your prey, and then find your way to its lair.Hunt the sunscale raptors to the south.  Slay them and remove the feathers they wear.  Place the feathers on the scytheclaw nests southwest of the Stagnant Oasis. Show their brethren you do not fear them!"
906,"Take Lok's head to Thork in the Crossroads, <race>. <snort> He should know what has happened to my tribe without any words--ha, not that he would believe Mangletooth helped in <snort> such things. But I am sure he'll reward you for carrying out such a great deed. <snort>I will continue to bless you with Agamaggan's power for as long as I remain in this cage, <race>. Until then, farewell."
907,"Now, <name>, you must face the great thunder lizards.  So large are the beasts, the ground rumbles as they stomp across the plains.  Take care as you fight them, for one false step and you may find yourself beneath their feet.You will find the thunder lizards in the southern Barrens.  They are known as Stormsnouts, Stormhides and Thunderheads.  Return to me after you have bested them."
910,"I have heard tales of the mighty ships that sail between Ratchet and Booty Bay!  That would be so cool to sail on the ocean and fight in many great sea battles.  Maybe I will be a mighty Horde sailor when I grow up!  Yeah!Would you take me to see the Ratchet docks, please?  I promise I won't get into the water or cause any trouble - I just want to see the big boats and smell the salty sea water!  Yeah!"
911,"They say that Ashenvale is the new frontier, and that the Mor'shan Rampart in the Barrens is the gateway to it.  That would be so cool to be a pioneer, carving everything you need out of the untamed wilds!  They say that this is where the Horde and Alliance will clash the most in the future, and I want to be there <name>!Would you take me to the Mor'shan Rampart so I can see what the frontier looks like, please?  I wanna see where the Horde is driving out those smelly night elves!"
913,"The thunderhawk, <name>, is a fierce beast.  It is time for you to face them.  You must find where it roams, and bring me its wings as proof of your successful hunt.Do this, and your time with me will near its end."
914,"The druids in the Wailing Caverns, the Druids of the Fang, are an aberration.  They were part of an order of noble druids whose plan was to heal the Barrens, but now seek to remake that land to match their own, twisted dreams.The Druids of the Fang have four leaders, and each possesses a dream gem.  Even now their faces haunt me!  Defeat the leaders and bring me their gems, and the Barrens may again know peace.Go, <name>.  You will find them lurking deep within the Wailing Caverns."
915,"ICE CREAM!  Oh please please please could you get me some ice cream?!  Strawberry is my favorite flavor, and there's no better strawberry ice cream in the world than Tigule and Foror's Strawberry Ice Cream!  It's my favorite ice cream in the whole wide world!I had it once a long time ago when I was at the Shimmering Flats race track, but I heard that they might be selling them in town now!  Please?  Pretty please?  With Tigule and Foror's Strawberry Ice Cream on top??!?!"
916,"I came to Shadowglen to observe the webwood spiders that dwell in the Shadowthread Cave.  They are cousin to a much smaller variety of spider; I believe the world tree has had a profound effect on them, and I would like specimens to study to confirm this.First, I would like some of their venom.  Gather Webwood venom sacs from the spiders in and around the Shadowthread Cave, to the north.  I can then examine them for similarities with their smaller cousin's venom."
917,"Now that I have the spiders' venom, I'd like some live specimens to study.  Unfortunately, capturing a living, giant spider is more than I can ask of you, young <class>.  And a giant spider is more than I could handle myself!But if you can find an unhatched egg, then delivering specimens will be much easier, and I can then arrange for the unhatched spiders to be contained.There must be a nest deep in the Shadowthread Cave.  Please, search for an egg in the nest and return it to me."
918,"The timberlings of Teldrassil are elementals of nature.  In some ways they reflect the natural order of plants and animals on our great tree.So it is disturbing to see how angry the timberlings have become.I believe it has something to do with the soil.  I have been working on different methods of nurturing plants and would like to try them on timberling seeds.  Please, can you gather seeds from timberlings around Lake Al'Ameth and bring them to me?"
919,"Small timberlings are sprouting around the waters of Lake Al'Ameth.  I'm afraid these sprouts are beyond help -- we should try to clear them from the land before they grow large enough to cause trouble.When you're wandering the lake, if you see any timberling sprouts please take them.  Help keep our land clean!"
920,"<name>, is it? I heard that Tenaron has been asking for you. You'll find him in the highest room atop Aldrassil.We may live long lives, but it's best you not keep him waiting too long."
921,"It is time for you to set out to seek your destiny, <name>. But before you are ready to set out into the world beyond our enchanted forests, there is much you must learn about our recent history.Much has changed with our people since the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Nordrassil lies a pale shadow of what it once was, its power used to defeat Archimonde and drive back the Burning Legion...There is a task you must perform. Go to the moonwell north of Aldrassil and return me a phial of its water."
922,"<name>, can you take one of the seeds you brought me to my friend, Rellian Greenspyre?  He is a druid in Darnassus, and when last we spoke he revealed his interest in my work with the Timberlings.  He had some ideas himself, and he will appreciate a specimen seed to work with.Thank you, <name>.  You have been a great help to me.  I hope that, some day, you will see the fruit of my labors.You will usually find Rellian walking the pathways of the Cenarian Enclave in Darnassus."
923,"There is a malevolence growing in the timberlings.  We are trying to find the source, but until we do...in order to keep Teldrassil safe we must cut down the timberlings who are beyond help.  Those that wander Wellspring Lake in northern Teldrassil are the most tainted.  They must be removed!Destroy the Timberlings you find there, and gather the mossy tumors growing upon them.  Bring the tumors to me so that they may be burned."
924,"The Demon Seed is a powerful tool for the Burning Legion. It rests in a cave on Dreadmist Peak, above a demonic altar of fire.I have prepared power stones that when placed near the Seed will disrupt its connection to the Legion.Take a stone from the table and bring it to the altar of fire atop Dreadmist Peak. Travel west, then north when the road forks. The Peak will be to your left. The safest climb to the top is on its northern face.And hurry--the stone's power will consume itself in time."
925,"They say that Cairne Bloodhoof is one of the greatest heroes the Horde has ever seen.  When I grow up, I wanna be a hero of the Horde too!Do you know Cairne, <name>?  Could you do me a favor, please?  Could you get his hoofprint for me?  I dunno how to ask him, and he'd probably be too busy for someone like me... but you!  You're an adventurer just like he is!  I bet he'd give you his hoofprint easy!Please?"
927,"The heart of Blackmoss the Fetid is covered with a dark, oily moss.  In fact, the only way to tell this is a heart is from its slow, rhythmic beat... A beat that continues even now.Perhaps Denalan will want to see this heart."
928,"While there is more I could speak to you of the moonwells and of Teldrassil, I must send you along. Corithras Moonrage will be expecting you. I have poured the phial of water you brought to me into this vessel to bring to him.Seek out Corithras. You will find him at the moonwell in Dolanaar. Follow the road south from Aldrassil out of Shadowglen, and continue to follow the cobblestones as the road turns west.Mind you stay on the road though, <name>. There are dangerous beasts in the forests of late."
929,"First, let me tell you more of the task you must complete. The druids in Darnassus use the water of the moonwells of Teldrassil, and their moonwell must be replenished from time to time. Using these specially crafted phials, you can collect the water of the moonwells.Take this vessel to the moonwell outside of Starbreeze Village to the east, and fill it with some of its waters, then return to me. When you have completed your task, I shall continue the story where Tenaron left off..."
930,"Hanging from beneath its fronds of this glowing plant is a large, round fruit.Denalan would want to study this fruit, you are certain."
931,"The fronds on this plant shimmer in the forest light, giving it a twisting, pulsing aura.You believe that Denalan would want a specimen of this."
932,"I must warn you, <name>, this matter must stay between us. The satyr are enough of an embarrassment to us already, and this one is much too close to home.He is called Lord Melenas. He resides in the nearby cave of Fel Rock where he has gathered a large group of grell warriors. His heart is black as night, and he plots something most foul.You must find him within his nearby cave just to the north of here, and bring me his head."
933,"There is another moonwell southeast of the entrance to Darnassus, on the shores of the Pools of Arlithrien. The Sentinels are having problems patrolling the area because of attacks and the growing ill-temperedness of the Gnarlpine furbolgs.Be wary as you seek out the well, and keep your weapons close at hand."
934,"All was not well with Teldrassil, however. Staghelm's carefully made plans for the new World Tree had borne out as he had hoped, but there was one small problem, a problem to which many of the troubles on Teldrassil may be attributed.However, I will not get into that yet. You must visit the last moonwell, to the northwest in the Oracle Glade. Under the boughs of the Oracle Tree lies the first and most powerful of our wells. Retrieve a phial of its water and return to me."
935,"Without the blessings of Alexstrasza the Life-Binder and Nozdormu the Timeless, Teldrassil's growth has not been without flaw. Strange beasts have been reported arising from the very ground of the tree, and crazed furbolgs attack passing travelers.I can only hope that the solution the Arch Druid is looking for will be found quickly. I will pour all the phials you brought into this vessel, for you to deliver to Darnassus.Bring it to Fandral Staghelm, you will find him in the druid grove."
936,"Excuse me <class>, but I'd like just a moment of your time if possible.The Cenarion Circle in Thunder Bluff is most interested in seasoned adventurers such as yourself to lend them aid in a vital research project.  While I do not know the specifics, I can inform you that none other than Hamuul Runetotem is spearheading this research.Please - if you are interested, speak with him directly on the Elder Rise within Thunder Bluff proper."
937,"I was dispatched with a small group of Sentinels here to protect the Oracle Tree from the harpies that have made nests all around the glade. Little by little we are trying to push them back.When the Oracle Tree attempted to send a runner to Darnassus with a report, the messenger was attacked and killed by a group of the harpies.If you feel up to the task, go to their nests, slay them, and return their belts to me as proof of your deeds."
938,"The sabercat's fur is a distinctive gray color, blending into the surrounding forest. As she lays there, you observe that she is badly wounded, with deep lacerations across her back and stomach.She raises her head and gazes at you, bright intelligence shining in blue eyes. She seems to wish to follow you."
939,"You study the simple wooden flute you picked up after defeating Xavaric.The knotted wood feels solid, but it seems as if the spirals and patterns in the surface begin to spin and move as you turn it over in your hands. Suddenly, you feel a sense of dread...You shake your head, sure that your mind is playing tricks on you.It's possible that other satyrs carry clues as to what you have found. Bring your findings to the druid, Eridan Bluewind, that lives in southern Felwood."
940,"The forest whispers of your feats of valor, <name>. As I felt the harpies forced from their nests, a greater calm spread across the forest, its creatures once again feeling safe. I have feared sending another messenger to the Arch Druid, but I know that you will see my message safely to him.Deliver this to him and know that the forest will see you safely along its paths to the forest of stone."
941,"I have removed that foul moss from the heart, but it remains tainted...Try placing the heart in my planter.  It is filled with a nutritive soil that may cleanse and heal the heart."
942,"This fossil bears a striking resemblance to one I once saw in Ironforge. An archaeologist by the name of Flagongut brought it to our annual Explorers' League conference. He believed the fossil had a power which could be unlocked somehow.Last I heard Flagongut had holed up in the Deepwater Tavern in Menethil Harbor, awaiting escort to the Whelgar Excavation Site. Seek him out and show him Remtravel's fossil. Perhaps he can reveal the secrets of the past.The ship to Menethil departs from Auberdine."
943,"Prospector Whelgar now holds the original fossil at his site in the Wetlands. When I discovered the Stone of Relu, I believed it to be the key to unlocking the mystery of the fossil.While I traveled on the road to meet Whelgar, I was attacked by raptors and the relic was lost. I don't know which one of the mottled beasts swallowed the relic but if you can retrieve it, I can unleash the power of these artifacts.Bring me both the Stone of Relu, and the original fossil he holds."
944,"It is strange that the naga are here, in Darkshore.  But stranger still...are the Twilight's Hammer.  That cult worships the old, old lords of the earth.  Lords defeated long ago.The Master's Glaive, to the south, is a place where such an old lord fell.Go there and look for more Twilight's Hammer cultists.Take this phial of scrying.  Use it to create a scrying bowl after searching the Master's Glaive.  Then speak to me through the bowl."
945,"Help!I was wandering around the Master's Glaive, and these dirty cultists surrounded me.  Lucky I'm good at hiding!!Can you help me out of here?  And I need to send word to my sister Therysil that I'm all right.  She's in Ashenvale to the south, at the Shrine of Aessina."
947,"I am devising a potion that requires rare mushrooms, mushrooms that grow only in a certain cave.  The cave lies behind Cliffspring Falls, to the east and slightly north along the mountains.I would go there myself, but I was advised by the Grove of the Ancients to stay away from that place.  Our venerable allies sense that the cave is the hiding place for a new evil in Darkshore.Please, <name>, gather the mushrooms for me.  And while doing so, scout the cave to confirm the Ancients' fears."
948,"Onu, an Ancient of Lore at the Grove of the Ancients, knows of your journey to Cliffwater Falls and wishes to speak with you.  The grove lies to the south, nestled near the mountains.The Ancients are patient and wise, <name>.  But if Onu seeks your counsel concerning what you saw in the falls, then I fear it is urgent."
949,The Twilight's Hammer's purpose at the Master's Glaive is not known.  But it must be dark.Search through their camp at the Glaive... Search for some thing that may teach us their intentions.For we must learn their intentions before a plan is made.
950,"Peering into the Twilight Tome is maddening.  Text begins to swim and dance after only a moment's glance, and once beautiful scrollwork twists into grotesque shapes.Tearing away one page of insane scribbles is all that is possible before a swoon overtakes you."
951,"The parchment you found at the Master's Glaive is a page from an ancient text...written by elves!  It is heavily cursed and tainted by the corruption of the Twilight's Hammer, but it seems the cult is using ancient elven magic to bring their old masters back to our world.Travel to the ruins of Mathystra to the northeast, and search for ancient relics among the grass and broken stones.  Through their study, we may divine how the Twilight's Hammer intends to exploit the magic of the elves."
952,"If you had enough time to run messages for the Oracle Tree, then I'm sure that I can press you into service to deliver a message to the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore, due south of Auberdine.You will most likely have to secure transport on a hippogryph, but I have faith enough in you that you can manage that. Take this to Onu, the Ancient of Lore. He has been awaiting word from me, even as I waited for news from the Oracle Glade."
953,"To the east you will find the ruins of Ameth'Aran. It is now inhabited by the restless spirits of the Highborne that once dwelt within its walls, but once it was a place where the servants of Azshara freely practiced their powerful magics.I was sent to explore the ruins and came across two large tablets, scrawled with the stories of Ameth'Aran and its fall. While I read the runes, I was accosted by the spirits, and fled.Please, if you can, venture to the ruins and decipher the tablets in my place."
954,"The ruins of Bashal'Aran to the east are overrun with demonic minions. The sprites and satyrs that have taken up residence in the area feed upon the magical energies of the area, their powers growing from continued exposure.Even with that, I have noticed that there is one shrine they will not approach. On the western side of the ruins, atop a small bluff, a strange blue aura permeates... There must be an explanation to the demons' reluctance.I would like you to investigate it."
955,"If I were to relate the story of my life, I have no doubt it would surpass the limits of your patience. Let us say that mine has been a long and painful life, and this spectral form is perhaps the worst torment of all.I am held here by the means of magic. Though my words may seem disingenuous, I assure you I would be grateful beyond words if you would help me find the means of my imprisonment. A seal binds me, and by examining the earpieces of the sprites and grells, I may find a trace of it."
956,"If the grells have come into close contact with the seal that binds my eternal prison, I suspect I know the cause. No doubt the seal has come into the possession of the satyr that lead them.I feel strongly that this must be true, <name>. One of the satyr must surely possess it. If you can obtain it, you would bring me so close to passing the bars of my prison that tears would come to my eyes."
957,"It was the craft of one of the most powerful of the Highborne that created the seal that formed my prison. In Ameth'Aran, the ruins to the south that are twin to these, persists even today an ancient flame, blue in color. In this flame this seal could be destroyed.Be wary in the ruins, <name>..."
958,"<class>. A task I would ask of you.Have you seen the ruins of Ameth'Aran? If not, you will find them on the eastern side of the main road, some ways to the south. Once they were the home of many powerful Highborne, now they are a testament to the destruction their dabblings produced.I have been told by the Sentinels that the spirits of the Highborne persist, and that they wield their ancient magical implements. Those relics must be appropriated, so that we might destroy them."
959,"Oops!Had a little mishap, as you can see! The morning cargo shipment from Booty Bay was huge. Huge I say! Never seen so many crates. Well, I was trying to expedite things so I started unloading a bit more than I could handle. That's when everything came tumbling down.Before I knew what was going on, I saw that menace, Mad Magglish, go running off with a bottle of 99-year-old port. Chased him all the way to Wailing Caverns. No way I was going in there.Maybe you're brave enough to find him?"
962,"The Royal Apothecary Society, based in the great Undercity of Lordaeron, has sent me here for a very specific service, <name>. Perhaps you wish to aid me, and in turn The Dark Lady in our efforts to advance the Forsaken.Recently I studied a rare specimen of flora named Serpentbloom. I believe in greater quantities this herb has great potential.Unfortunately Serpentbloom can only be found in the darkest recesses of the Wailing Caverns, a dangerous cave system located in the Barrens."
963,"In the aftermath of the battles at the Well of Eternity, I heard that Ameth'Aran had been destroyed, its people dead, including my love, Anaya.I would never have thought, thousands of years later, that memories of Anaya would still haunt my dreams. Wandering the woods of Darkshore in a stupor, I found myself in the ruins of Ameth'Aran... where I saw the haunted spirit of my beloved.She must be freed, but I lack the heart to do it. Her spirit must be destroyed."
964,"The key to Scholomance is called a Skeleton Key.  It must be forged from the remains of a skeleton - several actually - and hardened by only the strongest of metals within a suitable mold.  A signet of power from a being who naturally can open the portal to Scholomance will make the key ultimately function.First thing's first though, <name>.  We'll need skeletal fragments for the key's forging.  Skeletons inside Andorhal should yield what we need, but the ones outside the walls might work too."
965,"Hail, young <race>. I am Elissa Starbreeze, and it is my charge to protect Auberdine from harm.To this end, I sent Balthule Shadowstrike to observe the strange happenings around the Tower of Althalaxx to the northeast.It is past time that he should have returned. I worry that he has encountered some unforeseen danger in the forest. I would be most appreciative if you would find him and see that he is doing well."
966,"A group of warlocks has taken up residence around and inside the tower. I would have returned to Auberdine to report to Elissa earlier, but I was afraid that I might miss something while I was away.Delgren suspected such a company might be gathering at the tower, but did not know why.A few scraps of parchment that the warlocks carry have found their way to my hands, but I need more to complete the puzzle. I warn you not to venture into the tower, however, the warlocks there are much more powerful!"
967,"My master, Delgren the Purifier, is a paladin who has graciously offered his assistance in defending our forests from the forces of the demons and undead. He has taught me much about the Holy Light and the art of battle.Delgren must know of the cult's operations immediately.You will find him far south of here at Maestra's Post in Ashenvale Forest. Be swift, I fear the Dark Strand's threat grows with each passing hour."
968,"Although terribly worn and scratched, the title of this book can still be read upon its cover:The Powers BelowInside the book is a listing of unpronounceable names with foreboding titles, methods of worship, and preferred sacrifices...many of which include living, humanoid creatures.On the inside cover of the book are the words: ""Bonegrip's Runes and Dooms, The Forlorn Cavern, Ironforge.  Proprietor: Gerrig Bonegrip.""If Bonegrip sells books like this, perhaps he'll buy this one back."
969,"Ah, I can tell just by lookin'' at ya -- you be wantin'' to make a lucky charm. Mau''ari always knows!To da south. you''ll find a canyon, an'' giants made a'' solid ice. The giants sometimes be carryin'' dem, but ya can always gather da shards yerself from da canyon. These shards have a powerful reflective quality.Bring back 10 frostmaul shards, and my lucky charm will be yours."
970,"Balthule's letter is dire. This Cult of the Dark Strand is a thorn in my side that must be removed. I have been dealing with some of the Dark Strand scum northeast of here at Ordil'Aran. One of their number possesses a soul gem that I believe holds the secret to the cult's power.Bring it to me, and I will be able to decipher the secrets held within."
971,"As you might know, I collect lore.  Old lore.  Powerful lore.  Lore that opens doorways, and lore that can awaken Those Who Sleep.There are rumors of an old piece of lore, the Lorgalis Manuscript, at the bottom of Blackfathom Deeps in Ashenvale.  That place is the old dwelling of long-dead elves.  Elves who held great knowledge before their city fell to ruin.Search Blackfathom Deeps for the manuscript.  Do this, and I will not forget it.  Not even after ... the end days."
973,"Ilkrud Magthrull. Yes, I have knowledge of him. He is a powerful orc warlock that makes his residence at the Fire Scar Shrine,  a place of great evil in southwestern Ashenvale.He had been little more than an annoyance until now, and I had not dealt with him, but it seems that his time has come."
974,"The hot springs here are a source of mystery to me. Where does the heat come from?Looking at how close the pools are to Fire Plume Ridge, I really wonder if the volcano might have something to do with it. I created a thermometer to take readings of the temperatures at the volcano, and I'd like to find the hottest part. It gives the measurements in degrees Kraklenheit!Here, take it, and take readings of the temperatures at the ridge whenever you see a hot spot!"
975,"Now, before I give ya dis charm, I better explain how ta use it.If you carry da charm with ya, you'll find dat certain items will drop from creatures ya fight. If you don't have da charm with you, you won't find them. Understand?You'll know these special items by the name -- they be called E'ko. If you find any of these items, just bring dem to ol' Mau'ari, and she help ya out.Wait here while I fix your charm."
976,"Delgren has asked me to deliver messages and supplies to Sentinel Starbreeze in Auberdine, but I am loathe to leave on my own. Dangerous foes operate in the forest, and I do not wish to risk letting these supplies and information fall into the wrong hands.If you and others could act as my guards, I could leave now. With your protection, I have no doubt that we can see these goods safely to Auberdine."
977,"Now that I have what I need to cover the mechanical moving parts, I only need one other thing. Well, actually two. Two horns!The ice thistle patriarchs and matriarchs have the largest horns, so of course, those are the ones I want. That type of yeti inhabits a cave to the southeast. There are plenty of them there; you shouldn't have any problem finding them.Remember, I only want the best looking ones -- no beat up or broken horns, please!"
978,"Wildkin feathers from the Hinterlands appear to contain traces of magical qualities. These powers... they don't seem to be wielded by the creatures, it's more like they are simply inherent to the species -- part of their very essence.During my studies, I heard that a large population of wildkin inhabit the snowy lands of Winterspring. Could these creatures have the same powers? Please help me find an answer, <name>. Go to Winterspring and gather feathers that have dropped to the ground, then return to me."
979,"Yes, yes, these feathers seem to hold the same magical enchantment that I noticed previously... While I am not certain what we might find, I urge you to continue searching for answers, <name>.A colleague of mine recently traveled into Winterspring to observe the wildkin there, in their own habitat. Why don't you catch up with her and see what she has found?"
980,"Now, I've heard about other hot springs in a place called Winterspring, far to the north of here. The strange thing is, there are no volcanoes anywhere near them. Interesting, I know.Well, if you want to find out more, you should head to Winterspring and speak to a friend of mine. Her name is Donova Snowden, and she is currently staying by the hot springs there.Thanks again for helping me with my thermometer! See you later!"
981,"For all the work that you have done, you deserve to be well rewarded. Return to Delgren and tell him that Athrikus Narassin lies stilled by your hand, and the Cult of the Dark Strand is beaten and scattered."
982,"Off the coast of Darkshore to our north are two wrecked ships - the Silver Dawning and the Mist Veil.  Some time ago, both ships ran afoul of the blasted murlocs as they sailed across the vast sea into Auberdine.  They now lie at the bottom of the ocean as trophies for those fiends.Both captains didn't make it out that night, and their logs and other effects are still below in lockboxes.  I'd like for you to recover them for us; it would mean a lot to the crew members still around these parts."
983,"Hey! Help me with my latest invention, the buzzbox. You can talk to people far away!Maybe you've already seen them, they're boxes with levers on them. The only problem is they need constant maintenance.Each one suffers from a different problem, but I made a really smart decision. I placed each one near creatures that have the proper parts to fix that particular machine. Right now Buzzbox 827 is on the fritz. It's just south of Auberdine, real close. It takes 6 Crawler Legs to fix it. I'll pay ya..."
984,"Some of my brethren were rescued from a corrupt furbolg in Teldrassil, and I've vowed to stop any more atrocities before more of our kind are injured... or worse.I have seen a couple hints of corruption in Darkshore already, but I have yet to find any widespread signs. I think it would be logical if the investigation continued with the furbolgs. Would you find one of their camps, and return to me if you see any signs of corruption?"
985,"You've already proven adept at scouting our enemy, <name>. Do you have what it takes to fight them as well?Not all adventurers prefer straightforward combat to the art of stealth and evasion.If you think you're up for the task, then the furbolg camp south of Auberdine is currently the biggest threat to our people. You'll find some of the Blackwood tribe there. Kill 8 pathfinders and 5 windtalkers, and return to me here."
986,"<name>, your skills have already helped me in my endeavor. Could I impose on you again to help Grimclaw and his master Volcor? In addition, I can craft you a magical cloak that will allow you to walk unhindered by Darkshore's creatures while you look for him.To create the cloak, I'll need five fine moonstalker pelts from a moonstalker sire or matriarch to have enough material. The cats can be found near Wildbend River to the south, or even farther south near Ashenvale."
990,"<name>, my mistress, Raene Wolfrunner, awaits you in the city of Astranaar within Ashenvale. With your help, perhaps we can at least ease some of the corruption that's taken hold there.Head south from here and stay close to the road--you'll find your way there without issue if you follow those directions."
991,"<name>, a longtime friend of mine is also aiding the Sentinels here in Ashenvale, but he has yet to return.He had leads on finding an item that he thought could slow the furbolg attacks on our people--a rod created by a now-dead, evil wizard.Before he left here, he mentioned seeking out a gem for the rod.He mentioned the gem possibly being hidden at the shrine in Lake Falathim at the base of the mountain to the west. The gem was being held there before it was overrun.Find my friend, <name>, please."
992,"We've got a position open for a temporary junior-grade surveyor in the Gadgetzan Water Company, if you're interested!With the nomads seizing all our wells, we need to exploit more free sources of water!  There is water to be had in the desert, but only to those smart enough to survey them first.Take this dowsing widget and tap a sample of the water by the pool near Sandsorrow Watch.  It's right in sight of the trolls around there.  Bring the tapped widget back to me when you're done!"
993,"The cloak is complete, <name>. The time has come to find Volcor. I can only hope we are in time.The cloak's magic, once invoked, will not last long; perhaps five minutes. It will be up to you to know when to use it: I would suggest waiting until you find Grimclaw.If what he has told me is true, you will find his master in a cave south of here. Grimclaw will be alongside the road waiting for you. Signal to him by waving when you see him, and he'll point the way towards his master."
994,"All right, <name>, force it is. Let's get out of here as soon as you're ready. We'll fight our way down to the road--Grimclaw should still be there. Once there, we can part ways.Terenthis will want to hear your version of the story immediately, so head to Auberdine after we make it out of here."
995,"All right then... if you're sure, we'll sneak out of here. Let us leave when you're ready.Remember, after you've escaped, meet Terenthis back in Auberdine. I'll head there on my own since I'll probably be moving faster than you."
997,"Are you heading to the south?  To Lake Al'Ameth?  If so, then I have a task I might ask of you...My colleague Denalan has a camp along the eastern end of the lake, where he is studying and experimenting on the plant life of Teldrassil.  He requested a package of rare earths from Darnassus and it was late, only recently arriving here in Dolanaar.Can you take the package to him?"
1000,"Attention, heroes!The Cenarion Circle seeks able bodied individuals to assist them in exploring the vast new frontiers of Kalimdor!

1002,"The Buzzbox gives a burst of static as you hear Wizbang begin to speak.""The next Buzzbox is number 323. Ish north of Auberdine but... where's the ale? Wha? Oh, ish on the road sho ya shouldn't have trouble finding it near the bridge.""Wizbang mumbles something incoherent before you hear a loud gulping sound.""Thish one needs Moonstalker Fangs... 6 of 'em."""

1007,"I would charge you with a task, <name>.I was on my small vessel, skimming over the submerged ruins of Zoram, when naga attacked me, surging from the water and tearing at me with their claws!  I fled, carrying what supplies I could to make this meager camp.But when I reached the shore and ran... my prized possession was lost.Please, <name>, find the site of my ambush, along the coast to the north, and search for an ancient statuette.  It is the reason I have braved the dangers of the Zoram Strand."
1008,"There is evil lurking on our northwestern coast, known as the Zoram Strand.It is the resting place of the doomed city of Zoram, destroyed during the Sundering and submerged beneath the seas.  It has been lost to the night elves for ages.  Lost, and nearly forgotten.Now, the naga have returned, and for what reason we do not know.  But reason matters little; we must slay these fiends and throw them back to the depths!Return to me when your mission is complete."
1009,"I fear the ancient statuette's secrets will remain forever hidden unless you find the key to its ancient lock.That key is a ring, the Ring of Zoram.  It belonged to the rulers of this city before the waves of the Sundering drowned it.For years the ring was lost, but the naga have recently found it.Their leader, Ruuzel, dwells on an isle on the northern edge of Zoram.  Please, <name>, retrieve the ring for me!"
1010,"There is a plant that once grew in the old ruins of Bathran's Haunt to the north.  The plant was called Bathran's Hair and was known to cure ailments of the spirit.There is a sick child in the village, and I believe it is more than just a physical illness.  Will you go to Bathran's Haunt and search it for Bathran's Hair?  I may need it to properly treat the child.Bathran's Haunt lies north of Maestra's Post and just south of the border to Darkshore."
1011,"The Forsaken, the undead arm of the Horde, have crept into Ashenvale, lurking at our ruins and our barrows.  We believe their goal is to spread disease amongst the lands of the night elves.  We must confirm this!The Forsaken have a camp south of here, near the Dor'Danil Barrow Den, where they create poisons and diseases and place them in bottles.  Fight your way into that camp and steal a bottle of disease.  Return with such a bottle.  I will test it and find its purpose."
1012,"When I struggled with the Forsaken's poisons, I had a vision.  I had a vision of the druids in the Dor'danil Barrow Den, poisoned... murdered by the undead!  They are now errant ghosts, severed from their bodies and driven mad.So that the druids' spirits might some day find peace, you must enter the Dor'danil Barrow Den and destroy its once great leaders: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall and Mavoris Cloudsbreak.Do this, then return to me."
1013,"<name>, Shadowfang Keep holds a book, the Book of Ur, which would be much prized in my collection.  Ur was a great mage of Dalaran before the coming of the Scourge, his studies in other worlds are of much value to ... certain parties among the Forsaken.Enter Shadowfang Keep and find the book.

1016,"Take this divining scroll--it can determine the creator of these elementals. But you will need something from them to use as a reagent to focus scroll's magic--their bracers should do nicely.A few intact bracers from the creatures should be enough. The other bracers will be useless for our purposes, but they may be worth something to a merchant if you wish to sell them. Once you have the intact bracers attempt to use the scroll. Return to me with the results and we shall proceed from there."
1017,"There's only one undead mage in the Barrens capable of defiling this many water elementals. He's also the only one foolish enough to try. Sarilus Foulborne is probably sitting at the top of Dreadmist Peak, laughing at me.<name>, you must go into enemy territory and destroy this miscreant. I have had enough of his idiocy and we must show him what happens to those who annoy the Sentinels.Destroy him and bring me his head. Be wary though, the Horde may be watching for you."
1018,"Attention, heroes!The Cenarion Circle seeks able bodied individuals to assist them in exploring the vast new frontiers of Kalimdor!  A forbidden wasteland of unimaginable dangers lies far to the west of Tanaris and Gadgetzan, and the Circle needs willing and honorable proxies to act in their stead.All interested individuals should seek audience with the Cenarion Circle.  Speak with the Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem on the Elder's Rise of Thunder Bluff for more information!"
1019,"Attention, heroes!The Cenarion Circle seeks able bodied individuals to assist them in exploring the vast new frontiers of Kalimdor!  A forbidden wasteland of unimaginable dangers lies far to the west of Tanaris and Gadgetzan, and the Circle needs willing and honorable proxies to act in their stead.All interested individuals should seek audience with the Cenarion Circle.  Speak with the Arch Druid in Darnassus, Fandral Staghelm, for more information!"
1020,"<name>, I have created a cure that I believe will help the afflicted child.  Take it to Astranaar and give it to the child's parent, Pelturas Whitemoon.To reach Astranaar, follow the road south, then east."
1021,"Listen, I don't know who you are, but I need your help. My sisters went to take back the Branch of Cenarius from the satyr. They said they'd be back soon, but it's been two whole days!<name>, you have to find them! They were looking for the ruins of a night elf temple in Xavian to the northwest. I don't know what to think. Look for Anilia, she was leading them on the search."
1022,"Though we have put many resources and much effort into driving the remaining demons from the Felwood to the north, our successes have been few. We have been able to keep much of the demonic presence from Ashenvale.To the north, near the Felwood border, the ruined shrine of Mel'Thandris has been overtaken by mysterious wolf-men. Their chilling calls have led the area to be known as the Howling Vale. The Tome of Mel'Thandris kept at the shrine may shed some light on why these wolf-men have come."
1023,"As you rummage through Teronis' belongings, you find a journal that is still in good condition.You take the journal and leave Teronis' corpse as is.The only thing left to do is find the gem Teronis was seeking. Raene mentioned it being in the area. Perhaps the murlocs have it..."
1024,"You'll have to do the research yourself, but from what notes Teronis has made, it sounds like your next course of action is to find the other pieces of the rod Dartol created. I would start by heading to the moonwell east of Iris Lake. When you're ready, follow the road and turn north when you reach a small sitting area on your left.A dryad there named Shael'dryn is better suited to guide you. Seek her out.Keep the gem with you--Shael'dryn will need it if she's to help you recreate the rod."
1025,"Before you travel to the moonwell I have another task that will aid the people of Ashenvale if you would like to test your skills.Along the road heading east before the Falfarren River, furbolgs have been attacking travelers. Their tortured minds feeding upon fear, and their appetites satiated by the blood of innocents.Aid the Sentinels in protecting the lands by showing those monsters the same mercy they have shown our kind.I believe their camps are south of the road... be careful."
1026,"I wish your tidings were better.Raene is correct, I know about Dartol's creation and the treants in the area--at least I did once. They've become corrupted now, their nature twisted.If your goal is to find the next piece of the rod, then you'll have to find the key to open the chest it's in.The wooden key is on one of the treants northeast of here, near Felwood. Once you have it, look for a small glade west of the road near the Felwood border... the chest should be hidden around there."
1027,"The final piece of the rod was given to the druids of Dor'danil for safekeeping. I have no idea where they hid it. I'm sorry I can't help you more than that.All I can tell you is to follow the road that leads towards the Barrens. The druids took shelter to the east of that road, but they won't be of much help to you: they were killed recently... it's something I don't like to think about much.When you find the final piece, bring it to me and I will help you reconstruct the rod."
1028,"Here is the completed rod, <name>. Reconstructing it was simple... it's finding the shrine that has the power to recharge it that will be the hard part.With some focus and effort it shouldn't be too hard for someone like you, who's already accomplished so much.Head southeast of here--there are very few paths, so be careful--and keep your eyes to the north. The shrine is hidden within the mountains that surround this glade.Once there, place the rod within the shrine... the rest is magic. Hehe."
1029,"I suggest you find Raene and let her know the rod is finished. I'm sure she'll know what your next course should be.Good luck, <name>."
1030,"Alas, I'm not completely certain what he had in mind next.If what he said was true about the rod's power, then it will allow you to take on another form altogether. Which form, I do not know.Perhaps he meant to use its powers to get closer to the tainted furbolgs, but even the uncorrupted creatures would slaughter him were he not careful. Transformed by the rod, Dartol would have to speak to a furbolg who was safe from the effects of Fel Moss.I would start your search southeast of Mystral Lake."
1031,"Anilia puts her hands on your shoulders and draws you close. Gasping, she points towards the arch to the north, before her eyes close and her last wheezing breath leaves her body. ""He has taken it... Geltharis..."" You know in your heart that Anilia's dying wish is to see the Branch of Cenarius back in dryad hands."
1032,"I can't believe that Anilia is gone... We used to play together in the forests all the time. I almost feel... sad.I know something that might make me feel better. Please, slay the satyrs that took Anilia from me! Bring me their horns as proof of your actions and you will forever have my gratitude."
1033,"I had hoped Orendil's cure would save Relara, but I fear it only slowed the disease running through my child.  We must find more powerful medicine!  Thankfully, Orendil spoke to me of further remedies to try should his first one fail.Elune's Tear is a type of stone that rests in only one place: the isle on Iris Lake, east of Astranaar.  Orendil said the stone will wash away corruption... please, <name>, bring me Elune's Tear and pray it will end my child's sickness!"
1034,"Elune's Tear washed clear some of my daughter's sickness.  Her nightmares are lessened and I thank the goddess for her blessing.  But ... fever still rages within her.Orendil told me of a frosted dust found among the Ruins of Stardust.  Perhaps it will abate Relara's fever.  Gather some of the dust, then please return to me.The Ruins of Stardust lie to the south, <name>.  May Elune speed your journey."
1035,"Relara's fever has passed, but she is still very weak.  I do not believe time alone will give her back the strength she has lost.  I believe it will take the power of a moonstone.We used to gather moonstones at Fallen Sky Lake to the southeast... until the Shadethickets came.Their leader, a Shadethicket Oracle, gathered up all the fallen moonstones and hoards them.  Now, you must retrieve a moonstone from the Oracle.And to do that, I fear that you must slay him."
1036,"<name>... yeah, I've heard of you.  I've heard that you're no friend of Booty Bay - just like us Bloodsail Buccaneers.  Fleet Master Firallon is looking for hale and hearty < men / women> just like you for a special mission."
1037,"Velinde Starsong was my predecessor here in Ashenvale Forest. At first it seemed she had the situation in Felwood under control, but little by little her efforts faltered. One day, she simply disappeared.I was sent here to continue her work. I'm afraid I know nothing of the priestess, however. Perhaps Thyn'tel Bladeweaver, one of the commanders of the Sentinels, knows further details of her disappearance that I was not a party to.Surely she will understand the import of such information."
1038,"The Tome of Mel'Thandris showed you this? I suppose there would be little harm in allowing you to examine her belongings. This key will allow you to open the chest where we stored her things in the Sentinels' bunkhouse. She kept a journal of her duties, if there is anything to be learned, it will be from that.I should tell you, the Sentinels believe that she had her own reasons for leaving, and expect that she could return at any time. The priestess has done much in the past to earn our trust."
1039,"Ratchet is the only port in the Barrens. Most likely Velinde found a trading vessel in Ratchet to take her to Blackwater Cove in Azeroth. We've had limited dealings with the goblins that run the port, but the master of the dock should have information about the comings and goings of ship passengers.Follow the road southeast through Ashenvale and you will find yourself in the Barrens. Watch your step, <name>, warriors of the Horde patrol the land. You will be safe at the port, though."
1040,"Ah yes, finally found it. Should have told me she passed through here that long ago. Let's see.Velinde. Booked passage to Booty Bay on the Black Osprey. I don't have anything here saying otherwise, so I'd assume it arrived in port safely.Not much more help I can be to you, but she asked about overland travel over on that side of the world, and I mentioned Ruzzgot, a caravan driver based out of Booty Bay. Might be that this Velinde traveled with him.Move along, now. I haven't all day for you."
1041,"Turns out I was wrong about you, and that isn't something that happens everyday.It just so happens that I remember this Velinde you're looking for. Isn't every day that a night elf priestess that wants to travel with a dirty old--but great for your shipping needs!--caravan like my own.We split up on the way north, she was headed for Darkshire. The clerk there keeps all sorts of records. Might know something useful.Be careful in the jungle, it is a deadly place even at the best of times."
1042,"No, I don't have any records of a Velinde Starsong staying in Darkshire... though, if you don't mind me saying, I can hardly imagine a night elf priestess taking a room in the inn, if you get my meaning?These wolf-men you mentioned though, that's something I've heard about. Just the other day, Calor came into town with a string of their heads. He works with the Carevin family. Hunters of demons, undead, and other monstrosities. Speak with Jonathan, he's the head of the household."
1043,"Your story rings true... I do not entirely understand your motives, but if your business here in Duskwood involves ridding the forest of worgen in any number, then I can forgo understanding for results.There is a mine to the south that has been overrun with worgen... They appeared out of nowhere, but from what we know, that is where they first were found.Go about your business, but I would ask that if you find anything of import, you share it with me. We will accept any aid in our war against evil."
1044,"We shall rein in the worgen problem, have no worry of that. This evil that your friend introduced to our woods will be contained, and I bear her no ill will for her actions. Strange events are afoot in these times, <name>, and the darkness knows no respite.I will keep you no longer. I suspect that there are others that should hear of what you have found in the mines of Duskwood."
1045,"The night elves are as old as time, but their arrogance destroys their very world. And now it destroys our lives too. But that can no longer be controlled...I blame the elves for much, but we are still responsible for our actions. Even beyond the corruption, we are capable of great evil.Ran Bloodtooth is one such evil. Power hungry, lusting... the corruption has only made him stronger. My hatred for the elves burns, but I do not wish ill upon their children, so we must police our own."
1046,"Return to your own tribe and let them know of your victory here.Show them your trophy, and bask in the glory..."
1047,"Attention, heroes!The Cenarion Circle seeks able bodied individuals to assist them in exploring the vast new frontiers of Kalimdor!  A forbidden wasteland of unimaginable dangers lies far to the west of Tanaris and Gadgetzan, and the Circle needs willing and honorable proxies to act in their stead.All interested individuals should seek audience with the Cenarion Circle.  Speak with the Arch Druid in Darnassus, Fandral Staghelm, for more information!"
1048,"Whilst the Dark Lady tends to the pressing issue of the Lich King's advance to the north, I am seeing to it that matters closer to home are being taken care of accordingly.No doubt, the human pests who call themselves the Scarlet Crusade are proving to be the sharpest thorn in our side domestically. Tirisfal Glades is literally crawling with the little red ants.Travel to the Monastery, <class>, and lay waste to High Inquisitor Whitemane and her top lieutenants."
1049,"The Earthen Ring had pure intentions towards our plagued brethren. But who is to know the motivations of those whispering in the ears of the Elder Council?The Forsaken whom we have allied with have a history wrought with deceit. Too hasty was our pact. Perhaps Cairne would have been wise to heed the warnings from Orgrimmar.Deep within the Scarlet Monastery lies the Compendium of the Fallen, guarded by crazed human zealots. Their method is forged from insanity but their research might prove useful."
1050,"The future is inevitable! We hurl ourselves towards it like falling raindrops to the Great Sea.But perhaps, by studying the past, we can know what to expect and be better prepared for the unknown.Before dire troubles fell upon Lordaeron, there was a bastion of knowledge tucked away in the Tirisfal Glades. It is rumored that a book called Mythology of the Titans was housed in the library of the old Monastery.Bring it to me and perhaps together we can unlock the secrets of the past!"
1051,"Even though my will is free, I can serve the Dark Lady no more. I feel my time on Azeroth has come to an end. My life force is shattered.Interrogator Vishas did this to me! Tortured me for weeks! Took my wedding ring and gave it to his wife. The bastard!Revenge... I want revenge!The pompous fool bragged about his precious wife, Nancy, who lived along Lake Lordamere. Track the wench down, slay her and return my wedding ring to my wife, Monika in Tarren Mill.Heed my last wishes...."
1052,"We of the Scarlet Crusade lay claim to strongholds from Hearthglen to Tirisfal Glades. We are quite proud of our bastions of cleansing throughout Lordaeron.You have proven yourself against the undead in Desolace. But the true threat of the plague lies in Lordaeron.Travel to the town of Southshore, in the Eastern Kingdoms. Seek out a crusader named Raleigh the Devout. Give him this letter of commendation bearing my seal and he will escort you to a place of honor in our Scarlet Monastery."
1053,"I once served the Scarlet Crusade with honor, loyalty and pride. I believed their cause to be a noble one: to rid Azeroth of the undead.But as I spent time at the Monastery in Tirisfal Glades I realized that their grasp on reality was slipping. They now think everyone is plagued who doesn't wear the tabard of the Crusade. Innocent men and women were tortured because they were supposedly plagued.The Scarlet Crusade must be crushed in the name of the Light. You, <name>, must destroy the deranged regime."
1054,"Directly to the north of Astranaar are the Thistlefur furbolg. My scouts report that their numbers have grown greatly over the past few months. If they grow too great, they may find the courage to attack Astranaar directly.Kill as many of their kind as you can, but bring me their chieftain's skull as proof that their efforts have been stifled... for now.I shall remain here in Astranaar and await word from you. Elune be with you."
1055,"The rod, now complete, lies in your hands. Shael'dryn will want to hear of your success."
1056,"The forest spirits tell me you are brave and willing to travel.To the south, not far from Mystral Lake, there lies a tunnel named The Talondeep Path. Through this tunnel you will come to an area known as Windshear Crag in the Stonetalon Mountains. Once there, journey to the southwest past Cragpool Lake and then north, up the steep slope until you reach Stonetalon Peak.There awaits Keeper Albagorm. Heed his bidding, <race>.The journey will be perilous."
1057,"As a protector of the forest spirits you can undoubtedly guess why I am alarmed.You have traveled through these mountains to reach this peak. Surely you have seen the travesty which has befallen the land. Greed has led to the destruction of these sacred hills.The Charred Vale to the south was set afire by the greedy mechanized army of industrialists. Worse yet, the Bloodfuries that have encroached on the land refuse us passage in to begin regrowth.Drive the wretched harpies out, <name>!"
1058,"So excited I am!Three little cages for three little elves! But what shall we do with our lovely tree-hugging friends? Why, let's give them a taste of... what do they call it... forest magic!I'll need a good mess of Stonetalon sap. From those horrid felines, bring me some twilight whiskers. This calls for plenty of courser eyes, of course -- can never have enough eyes. Oh, and lest we forget, a precious scale from a fey dragon.Hurry to Stonetalon Peak, <name>, so I can brew some forest magic!"
1059,"The Bloodfuries have been subdued. But they will regroup soon enough if action is not taken.Far south of the Barrens lies a land known as Thousand Needles. If you travel west in Thousand Needles until you reach the lush forest's edge of Feralas, you will find a druid named Falfindel Waywarder.This great and wise druid is capable of calling forth great forest spirits which can aid in the reclamation of the Charred Vale.Send word of our need! Seek him out at once!"
1060,"You've done so well for me, <name>. You're a regular lucky rabbit's foot and there's something I want you to see.The harpies are not from around the Barrens. They come from a place called Stonetalon, far to the northwest of here. Though it is probably a dangerous place for you, I need this letter delivered to an old friend of mine who lives there, a witch doctor by the name of Jin'Zil.He'll be happy to know that Serena Bloodfeather is dead, and I think you'll find Stonetalon an interesting place."
1061,"The spirits of the Stonetalon Mountains are angered, for goblins and their servants are plundering and burning the land.  So the land has cried out, and those who listen for such things... have heard.Seereth Stonebreak, a promising shaman of the Horde, was sent to Stonetalon.  She reports massive deforestation at the hands of the goblins, and requests aid.Meet Seereth in Stonetalon.  To reach her, follow the road west of the Barrens' Crossroads.  She is camped near the Greatwood Vale."
1062,"The goblin-run Venture Company moved into the Stonetalon Mountains, chopping down trees and burning huge stretches of forest.  The spirits of this place are nearly blind with pain and rage.  We must stop the Venture Company!Head northwest, beyond the Greatwood Vale and into the Windshear Crag.  You will find the goblins and their servants at work--show them the Horde will not allow the exploitation of Stonetalon.  Show them in the language they best understand...Violence."
1063,"To truly tend the spirits of Stonetalon we must consult the tauren elders.I do not know many of their leaders' names, but I do know of one: Magatha.  I have heard that she is very old, and she knows much.  If anyone can marshal spiritual aid from the tauren, it is she.Magatha resides in the tauren capital of Thunder Bluff, on Elder Rise -- the city's northeastern bluff.  Speak with Magatha, and tell her of the peril of Stonetalon Mountains."
1064,"The tauren have a bond with the land, and it pains me to hear of Stonetalon's plight.  But I fear that to heal the land, we must first remove the disease upon it.Is it not fortunate, then, that the Forsaken are allied with us?  They know much of disease.  I believe they can aid us, and by doing so they will strengthen the trust between our people.Speak with Apothecary Zamah.  She is a scholar and an emissary of the Forsaken.  You will find her in the Pools of Vision below the Spirit Rise."
1065,"To rid Stonetalon of the Venture Company, we must take extreme measures.  Extreme, but without bloodshed.A colleague of mine may have just the tool we need.  His name is Lydon; he dwells in the town of Tarren Mill in the Hillsbrad Foothills, in the distant land of Lordaeron.To reach Hillsbrad, travel by zeppelin to our capital, the Undercity.  Then go north to Tirisfal Glades, southwest to Silverpine, and south to Hillsbrad.Seek Lydon and bring him this note.  It details our needs to him."
1066,"I will create a toxin to bleed the violence from the Venture Company, rendering them weak and docile.  That should fix the Horde's problem in Stonetalon, yes?But to create the toxin, I will need the blood of innocents, a difficult ingredient to obtain.Fortunately the Syndicate, a group of human brigands in this area, employ shadow mages... and those mages collect innocent blood for their own, unsavory purposes.You can find the Syndicate shadow mages in Durnholde Keep to the southeast."
1067,"Here is the toxin.  If you use it against the Venture Company it should produce favorable, perhaps even contagious, results.  I must say, it is quite exciting to see my work applied in the field!But before using it, take it to Apothecary Zamah.  She must create a delivery method for the toxin to maximize its effect."
1068,"There is a relation to the spiritual magic of shaman and the natural magic of druids.  This is why we shaman can hear the plea of the spirits of Stonetalon.  Many of their whisperings are lost to me, but one message, one vision, is clear...I saw a vision of two man-shaped machines in Windshear Crag, northwest of Greatwood Vale, felling trees with impossible speed.  These metal beasts must be stopped!In my vision, the machines were marked with strange symbols:XT:4 and XT:9."
1069,"Spider egg omelettes are a new fad in Booty Bay!  The problem is... Booty Bay's got no eggs.I smell an opportunity!In Windshear Crag and Sishir Canyon, in the Stonetalon Mountains to the northwest, lives the deepmoss spider.  Bring me its eggs and I'll pay a bundle!In Windshear Crag, the eggs will be clustered under what trees remain.In Sishir Canyon... well, if you have a weak stomach then maybe you should just collect the eggs at Windshear Crag..."
1070,"Hello, <name>.You seem to be full of wanderlust by the looks of you. Have you been to the Stonetalon Mountains? It is a land plagued by the Venture Co. and other enemies of the night elves.Recently, Sentinel Wolfrunner sent my friend Kaela Shadowspear there to investigate what's happening to the land, but I have yet to hear word back from her. I'm even more concerned because the Alliance sent a gnome mage along with her... a sign of trouble for sure.Would you find her and report back to me?"
1071,"You see, <name>, I'm a member of the Enlightened Assembly of Arcanology, Alchemy and Engineering Sciences, and it's my goal... nay, my DUTY! to show the night elves that a blend of magic, mixtures, and mechanisms can help save their forests.But it's a hard fought war, and the goblins reproduce like rabbits it seems. I haven't even had time to build my newest inventions!I need some time to plan and organize. But to do that, I need your help keeping the goblins at bay in Windshear Crag to the east..."
1072,"The device I'm thinking about is my most advanced version to date. But we'll need a special potion if it's to work. I'm thinking we might as well get the good stuff since this mission could be your last.And for that, we're going to need some potent explosives: Nitromirglyceronium.The only person who can make NG-5 is an old friend of mine: Lomac Gearstrip. Look for him in Tinker Town.You talk him into making us some NG-5, I'll get to work on placement for my devices."
1073,"Hahaha... you need Nitromirglyceronium to stop goblins from destroying a forest?!I don't care if you know Gaxim or not... I'll give you the stuff just to see you or them explode into itty bitty pieces.There's a problem though: I'm all out.But I'll tell you what, you bring me the correct potions, and I'll make some up for you right away.The least you can do is prove you've got some skill as an alchemist before I just give you a sample of my greatest creation."
1074,"Here you go, stranger. Take heed with it though... it's volatile stuff.If you're really a friend of Gaxim's, then tell him I say hello. If you're not, then have fun blowin' yerself up."
1075,"Okay, now for the remote detonation part of my plan... oh, I haven't explained that yet, have I?Okay, so the short of it is this: with a little magic, I can make it so the explosives go off while you're not around. I'm putting together a device that'll allow you to push just one button and have the NG-5 explode when you're ready.But I need a spell from a friend in Stormwind--Collin Mauren is his name. You can find him in the mage quarter there. He's human, so he shouldn't be hard to miss."
1076,"Ah, I think I have it. A messaging spell... I believe that's the effect he's looking for.I'll have to create a scroll with the spell impressed upon it. To do that I'll need debris from a dust devil.While I gather the rest of the components, why don't you head to Westfall and find one of the foul creatures? They are dangerous, but I'm sure it's nothing you can't handle if you're willing to subject yourself to one of Gaxim's experiments.I'll be here when you return."
1077,"Here you are, <name>. This should do nicely.Please give my regards to Gaxim when next you see him. I look forward to hearing about this adventure when it sees its completion.Fare well."
1078,"Travelers keep asking me about the Stonetalon Mountains. It seems to be a popular place for adventure--it doesn't matter if you're seeking wyvern, elementals, or you have business with the Venture Co.Within the Charred Vale, deep in Stonetalon, there used to be a species of basilisks whose scales, when ground to dust, made a wonderful reagent for some spells I've created.If those basilisks still live, I would love to have a few of their scales.Take your time, it is no rush, but I can pay well."
1079,"This is it, <name>. Pay close attention. The devices are done, and ready to be used.Take these pages--they'll explain more about the detonators and explosives, and where you should place them.Remember, the success of your mission doesn't depend on how much destruction you cause. Plan Alpha's success depends on you bringing back the Venture Co.'s engineering plans from inside the lumber mill south of Cragpool Lake."
1080,"Plan Beta's just like Plan Alpha, <name>.We cause a distraction and then steal their precious letters.The key is to get their letters... remember that.The pages I gave you already will tell you where to plant the explosives. Just get back here alive and with those letters...."
1081,"<name>, I am sure Tyrande Whisperwind herself would like to thank you for taking part in this mission.It may not appear so on the surface, but what you've helped start could very well strengthen our foothold in the Stonetalon Mountains.If you consider yourself our ally against these atrocities, go see Tyrande in the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus."
1082,"<name>, you have done a great deed by lending a hand here.The Sentinels of Ashenvale will reward you well if you informed them that Gaxim and I are alive. Tell them we are well on our way to stopping the Venture Co. and healing the lands.Find Tara Thenysil in Astranaar; she will be pleased to see you've returned with good news."
1083,"I'm unsure what the Venture Co. did to the Vale, but it's obvious they were overpowered by the creatures there.They set the forest aflame, and used their inventions of destruction to decimate as much of the Vale as possible.But in their ignorance they also released something else: burning spirits, elementals of flame, stone and rage.The land has no chance to see Elune's smile while these creatures roam free.Bring me their smoldering embers to show you've reduced their numbers."
1084,"It seems obvious to me that the protectors of the Vale--the treants--had something to do with the Venture Co. being driven back. Unfortunately, even those once great guardians have now become corrupt.Gaxim thinks their corruption is somehow linked to the weapons the goblins used during their retreat.I told him I'd collect a sample from a wounded treant and allow him to study it in order to figure out if that's true.Bring me some of the shrapnel so the gnome can tell me more..."
1085,"The situation here in Stonetalon is obviously grave for a night elf and gnome to be working together.The Venture Co. has devastated these lands and I've spent most of my time putting an end to the destruction.Do not judge Gaxim prematurely; he understands the need for us to work together.If you wish to aid us, then start by speaking to Gaxim.I'm sorry I cannot send you back to Tara with good news yet. Perhaps soon."
1086,"The toxin is ready.  All that remains is its delivery.  You, <name>, must make that delivery.The Venture Company must have a means of sending messages and light cargo between its headquarters and its operations in Stonetalon.  It is likely a small sky port -- not big enough for a zeppelin, but perhaps for a flying machine.  You must search the areas in Stonetalon under control of the Venture Company and find this sky port, if it exists.  If you find it, then place the toxin there.Place it, and run."
1087,"You cannot imagine the hatred I possess for this wretched land. The ilk of Cenarius and the kaldorei druids at the peak employ their pathetic powers to stifle the flow of magic, even so far south of their pathetic holdings... their beloved forests.Would that I could return to Jaedenar and exult in the flow of magic, but my master will not allow me to return until my work is done.I have no doubt you love the night elves and their allies as little as I. Aid me, and both our ends might be satisfied."
1088,"They thought that they could halt the flow of magic. They were mistaken. They thought that they could hide Ordanus, but I will have his head!Magic grants me true sight. Yes... there he is. A crossroads... At the top of a great tree in Ashenvale Forest. A name... Raynewood. One of the eldest sons of the forest god. They spirited him away from the peak before I could find him, but his time runs short.Bring it to me and I will share with you a mighty gift."
1089,"The druids built the Talon Den on Stonetalon Peak, where they keep many powerful items.They devised a complex scheme to keep them from falling into the wrong hands.Luckily, I managed to... extract some details from one of them.Hidden in a small lantern at the entrance of the Den, you will find the Gatekeeper's Key--with it you will be able to open caches around the Den. The items from these caches will allow you to open their hoard, located in one of the central areas."
1090,"You know, I was once the second most important person here at this site. That all changed when Gerenzo took over. Fired my boss, Ziz Fizziks, and sent me down to work in the mines. Ziz told me to stay here and gather information, though. His new boss will pay us well if we can find out what Gerenzo's plans are.Anyways, what I do know is that Gerenzo has ordered large amounts of this gold-green ore to be mined. I can get you a sample to bring to Ziz, but you'll have to watch for patrols while I get it."
1091,"<name>, take these letters to Kaela. I'm sure she'll want to know about this. Or at least the Sentinels will.Make sure you tell her how successful we were and how we couldn't have done it without a little bit of magic."
1092,"I guess I'd better think about getting out of here, also. It won't take long for word of what happened here to spread to the higher ups, and I'm sure they wouldn't take too kindly to meeting me again.I'll sneak out and meet with Ziz. Hopefully, he'll be able to find me a new job!I'll try and clean up this mess a little, but you should take the ore sample to Ziz right away. He told me that he'd set up camp somewhere on the western side of Windshear Crag. Good luck."
1093,"Terrible what the Venture Company has done here, eh? What were they thinking? Goblin company hiring a gnome!Lucky for me, Sputtervalve knows a genius when he sees one. Hired me just after I'd been kicked out!Tells me they built some enormous woodcutting machine, and Sput' wants me to steal the plans for him. Unfortunately, Gerenzo--bloody gnome--wants me dead on sight... maybe you could steal the plans for me? You should be able to find them on one of their operators."
1094,"This envelope has all the information I was able to snatch as they booted me out the door... Venture Company internal documents, some manuals, technical things... Oh, and of course the Super Reaper 6000 blueprints.Sputtervalve has taken up residence at Ratchet in the Barrens. Shouldn't have much trouble finding him, he's a little green fellow."
1095,"The matter of this gnome that has been hired by the Venture Company has caused a bit of a stir in Undermine. The trade princes do not approve of Razdunk's consorting with this Gerenzo.Riddlevox has asked me to take care of the problem, and I'm sure he was instructed to do so by one or more of the trade princes. Of course, the Director didn't tell me that. Let's just say I have a hunch.Whatever the case, Gerenzo must be removed, and it would be a fitting test to have Fizziks take care of him."
1096,"I met Gerenzo once, but let me tell you, he's not easy on the eyes. His flesh looks like it's rotting away, and he's grafted metal and gears onto his body, replaced some of his limbs with mechanical ones.Northeast of here, far above Cragpool Lake, up near the water wheel is where Gerenzo watches over the entire site. There's no way I could fight my way up there, not to mention take on Gerenzo... But you look like you might be able to make it.If you kill him for me, I'll make it worth your while!"
1097,"There's a dwarven weaponsmith in Stormwind, Grimand Elmore, who sent word that he needs help with a delivery.  I believe he wants a package sent to his homeland in the north.You have a sturdy pair on you!  So if you're interested in some legwork then speak with Grimand.  We could use you down here, but we must also keep our ties strong with the dwarves.You can find Grimand Elmore at the weapon shop in the Dwarven District of Stormwind, in the northeast section of town."
1098,"In preparation for an assault on Shadowfang, two deathstalkers were sent to the keep to gather intelligence.  It has been many days and they have not returned, but we must receive their report if we're to have any hope of a successful attack!So here is your task, <name>.  Go to Shadowfang Keep to the south and find the Deathstalkers Adamant and Vincent.  Find them, and if they require aid then give it.This mission is as dangerous as is it critical, <name>.  Do not fail."
1100,You slowly open the weathered journal of Henrig Lonebrow....
1101,"Poor Heralath! And this dwarf... Lonebrow. What a brave soul he was.We must not let their valiance go for naught. This crone... Charlga Razorflank ... must be stopped.Surely, infiltrating the Kraul will be perilous. There isn't time to send word to Darnassus. <name>, assemble a party to slay the crone.Bring me Razorflank's Medallion as proof of demise."
1102,"Cairne is a noble leader for uniting our people here on Thunder Bluff.But I cannot forgive those who drove us from our ancestral lands as easily as some. My people inhabited the southern Barrens for decades. The land was holy to us. But we were driven off by numerous foes.A vengeful fate awaits the crone, Charlga Razorflank, who musters a foul army from within Razorfen Kraul.Bring me Razorflank's heart and I can die in peace, <name>."
1103,"Greetin's, < brotha/sista>! Have you too come to purify the waters here and prove your understandin' to Islen?I've just defeated the corrupt water spirit meself, and I'm just 'bout to put da bracers and remaining drops o' water on the brazier.What's dat? Ahhh. Tiev understan' all too well when somethin' goes wrong. Well, Tiev can help you plenty if you be needin' to see the pure water spirit again.Bring me a water sapta from Islen as proof that you be ready, an' I'll wait to turn in me parts."
1104,"I have so many designs for our rocket car!  So many!  And I must try them all!!I'm working on a new type of fuel.  One that burns really really really hot!!  I haven't gotten the mixture perfect, but I think I know what I need...The scorpids who wander the Shimmering Flats have a venom with lots and lots of salt in it.  It's very unique!  And it's just what I need!Bring me venom and trust me -- our car will fly!!"
1105,"My brother is working on a new fuel for his rocket car.  He's brilliant, he really is.  So brilliant that... I think that new fuel he's designing is strong enough to eat right through the car's chassis!I want to reinforce its fuel tanks before that happens.The tortoises out on the flats have very hard shells.  I want to use them to create new tanks for our rocket car.  Tanks that can hold my brother's new fuel.You look responsible enough.  Will you get me those shells?"
1106,"I'm developing a new engine that'll make the car go so fast!  Fast enough to fly, I know it!  I just need to make pistons that can handle very very heavy stress.  All my trials have failed because I can't make pistons hard enough!But there is someone who might know how.His name is Martek the Exiled.  He is a great smith and knows more about metal than anyone.  Take him this letter, I know he can help!But he's far far away -- in Azeroth, in the Badlands, in a camp, with a goblin!Find him!"
1107,"Our rocket car is the fastest thing on the flats!  So fast that ... I'm afraid friction is going to tear it apart!To prevent that I need to create a composite to coat the car's moving parts.  It must be hard but not brittle, and must be resistant to salt corrosion, or time spent on the Shimmering Flats will eat it away.Have you heard of the Vile Reef, <name>?  It's off the coast of Stranglethorn Vale.  Saltscale murlocs live there, and their tail fins are a crucial ingredient of my composite."
1108,"I'm not out here just to stay away from people.  There is a wealth of metal in the Badlands, <name>, if you have the guts to get it.The metal's called indurium and as luck would have it, it is rumored to possess high resistance to heat and stress.  It might work for Fizzle's car.But let's make sure.  Get me samples of indurium and I'll test its properties.True indurium ore lies deep in Uldaman, but the Stonevault troggs of the Badlands sometimes have flakes of it on them.  Bring me those flakes."
1109,"As you can see, <name>, we're up to some very.... interesting experiments at the Royal Apothecary Society.As the Master here, it is my job to oversee the most ambitious of our alchemical attempts. So much work and so little time!You look well traveled for a <class>. Perhaps you can aid me.I'm in need of a rare substance. It's foul material; it comes from a rare species of bats only found in the muck-hole known as Razorfen Kraul. Bring to me the guano from the Kraul Bats so we can begin our work..."
1110,"Heh heh, with all the races they're running here, it's no surprise that a few mishaps happen along the way.  If you look around the Shimmering Flats then you'll see evidence of past crashes -- scraps of rocket car parts are littered everywhere!And those parts are worth money to the gnomes and goblins.  They're always looking for more contraptions to slap onto their cars.So go out and get me parts.  Bring me a heap and I'll pay you well."
1111,"I make it my job to get people what they need, and the gnomes over there need a parts order filled.  Their parts were shipped to Ratchet a week ago, but I haven't been able to make the trip.So, are you ready for some legwork?  Go to Ratchet and give this parts order to Wharfmaster Dizzywig -- he'll probably be at the docks.Do this for me, and I'll have more jobs for you.Jobs, my friend, with serious profit potential..."
1112,"Here's Kravel's package, <name>.  And when you deliver it, tell him... if he wants more special orders, then he'll have to pay his tab!"
1113,"Why do I need a rare type of guano, you might ask. Well, for this experiment I want to see what effect two diametrically opposed chemical substances can have on each other, especially when both are combined with an ever-toxic agent to ensure the most... ghastly results.In the northeastern peaks of Tirisfal Glades lies the Scarlet Monastery. There the crazed disciples of the Scarlet Crusade congregate, both inside and outside the halls. Which you slay matters not, any of them may have the heart I need."
1114,"Now that I have what I need, give these parts to Fizzle Brassbolts.  He's been waiting a long time for them -- I'm sure he won't miss the little piece I removed from his order...And I wouldn't bother mentioning it to him.  It was small and worthless.Trust me."
1115,"Now that we've done a service for the gnomes, it's time to do the goblins a favor!I hear that the goblin racer pilot, Nazz Steamboil, didn't always use that name.  I wonder why he changed it.  I wonder if it's a secret, and... I wonder if he values that secret.If anyone knows the truth, then it's Krazek of Booty Bay, on the southern tip of Stranglethorn.  Speak with Krazek and ask him about our goblin pilot.If you can get useful information from him, then we might just turn a profit from it."
1116,"Getting the information on Nazz is quite a favor, <name>.  Yes, quite a favor.  But you've come all the way from the Shimmering Flats to get it... are you willing to travel some more?While I contact my sources, why don't you gather something for me, eh?Hm... what will it be?  How about dream dust, from the dragon whelps of the Swamp of Sorrows.  Yes, I'd love some dream dust for my snuff pouch!Get it for me, <name>, and I'll give you the information you seek."
1117,"I had to use some of my favors, and gave away a rare bottle of elven wine, and did some heavy deducing myself!  But I found the information you seek.Here, I wrote a letter with some very interesting bits on our friend, Nazz Steamboil.  Do with it what you will -- it's too dangerous for me to use.Just don't tell anyone where you got it!"
1118,"<name>, you're a <class> I can trust, both to get the job done and to keep your mouth shut while doing it.I've been brewing up a new scheme.  It's risky, but if it works then we could both make a bundle!  And I think you're just the person to see it through.To start, you must go back to Booty Bay.  I apologize, good <name>.  I know my last task took you there.  But this time, speak with Crank Fizzlebub.Give him this letter.  And if he requires aid, do your best to help him.  It will be worth the effort."
1119,"I figured out how to use Zanzil's mixture with stout to make a powerful libation.  A Fool's Stout.  I think it'll be just what Kravel needs, but try it out and let me know how it works.And <name>, don't keep this stuff too long without using it.  Zanzil's mixture has a weird effect on the stout's yeast, kicking it into high gear.  So it won't stay fresh forever."
1120,"We need to try the Fool's Stout on one of the pit crews.  If you want to try it on the gnomes, then here -- take the stout and give it to the gnome pit boss.And don't wait too long.  This stout will go bad eventually."
1121,"We need to try the Fool's Stout on one of the pit crews.  If you want to try it on the goblins, then here -- take the stout and give it to the goblin pit boss.And don't wait too long.  This stout will go bad eventually."
1122,"That Fool's Stout worked great!  I placed a bet on the next race, and... let's hope the crew you got drunk did a number on their car!There's only one more task for you -- take this note back to Crank Fizzlebub in Booty Bay.  He'll want to know of the successful test.And hopefully we can get more of that Fool's Stout for future races!"
1123,"For this task, Keeper Remulos' majordomo in Moonglade - Rabine Saturna - seeks aid in exploring the vast wastelands far to the west of Tanaris and Un'Goro.  He is located in Nighthaven, the main village of Moonglade.I want to impart on you the importance of your presence.  There are growing tensions between the night elves of Darnassus and the Cenarion Circle in Moonglade.  Look beyond racial boundaries and tap into the wisdom of your ancestors in dealings with the Circle there, <name>.  Good luck."
1124,"West of Un'Goro Crater, via the northwestern ridge, is a harsh wasteland - Silithus.  Few know that an ancient war was waged there between the night elves and a malign, alien power.  The evil was sealed, but now we suspect that forces work to stir this... unspeakable horror.Seek out Layo Starstrike, one of our agents in Silithus; look for him at Valor's Rest, the final resting spot for the fallen of the wastes.  Give him this letter, and he will give you his trust accordingly."
1125,"To our southwest lies a tragic site - the ruins of Southwind Village.  This is where our work should begin, <name>.From what we've learned, this village was once a night elf base of operations for Silithus.  It's long since overrun by the silithid hives that infest the wastes.  I can only imagine the horror of the village's initial sundering...The tortured spirits of fallen druids and sentinels wander the ruins aimlessly.  Explore this locale, freeing the souls of these wretched beings as needed."
1126,"The hive needs to be addressed in Southwind Village, and I think I know a way to get at them.  It's been my experience that the silithid hives are very sensitive to their environment; this explains their attacks when hearing the death wails of the spirits.The silithid are strongest in the tower - the one with the mass of wasps circling it.  Scale the tower and jostle the hive into activity.  Report back what you learn, but be careful!  If you uncover anything that might help, bring it to me."
1127,"So you want some Fool's Stout, eh?  Thinking of heading back to the races...?All right, bring me more of Zanzil's mixture and I'll make some more stout for you."
1130,"<name>, Melor Stonehoof has heard of your deeds, and has set a path before you.If you wish to take it, then go to Thunder Bluff and speak with Melor.  You will find him on Hunter's Rise."
1131,"At times we hunt for food.  At times we hunt for honor.  And at times we hunt to earn the Earthmother's teachings.But the hunt I now set upon you is none of these things.  It is to slay a creature outside the Earthmother's blessing.The hyena Steelsnap roams the Thousand Needles, south of the Barrens.  He is a tyrant, attracting other hyenas to him and spreading fear and bloodshed among more peaceful beasts.Find Steelsnap, <name>.  Find him, and defeat him."
1132,"Oh, to be at sea once again!  To feel the kiss of the wind, and to have the waves rock me like my blessed mother, long ago!Oh, I wish I had your fortune, good <class>, for I see the sea in your future!It's my job to tell eager souls of the land of Kalimdor, the land of opportunity!  If you're willing to try your luck across the sea, then take a ship from here to the lovely port of Theramore.  Speak there with my partner, the elf, Fiora Longears.She'll start you on your Kalimdor adventure!"
1133,"If you're fresh off the boat from Menethil, then the first thing you should do is... go to Astranaar.  I'm sure an eager member of the Alliance such as you can do some real good there.  Speak with Shindrell Swiftfire and offer your services.But don't bother mentioning who sent you.  Shindrell does not know me..."
1134,"We are not in open war with the Horde, but our peace is fragile.  We often find their agents moving against us, but they do so covertly.One such advance was revealed to us from hidden sources in Theramore, claiming that the orcs collect venom from the pridewings near Mirkfallon Lake, in the Stonetalon Mountains to the south.  Orc assassins then use the venom on their secret death raids against the Alliance!If this is true, then we must stop them, <name>.  We must deny them their source of venom."
1135,"As you may know, wyverns are often tamed by orcs for use as mounts.  But what is less known is that the venom of a wyvern, in some circles, is more valuable than the beast itself.  So if you're not afraid to do a little wyvern hunting, then... I have a job for you.There is a place called Highperch in the land of a Thousand Needles, west of here.  The Highperch wyverns have a potent venom.  Potent, and valuable."
1136,"<name>, it is now time for you to travel to far-off lands.  You are ready.You now hunt Frostmaw, a yeti in the Alterac Mountains.  He is elusive, his white coat blending into the snows of his mountain home.  He rarely shows himself.But I will show you how to entice a creature such as he.  Here, take this scroll.  On it I have written how Frostmaw may be lured.Now go, <name>.  Your journey is long and many challenges lay waiting.  When you return with Frostmaw's mane, only then is your task complete."
1137,"Indurium has an amazing resistance to heat!  I'm sure it will work for Fizzle's pistons.  But he'll need true indurium ore, not just the flakes.To get the ore, it must be mined from deep within Uldaman, on the northern borders of the Badlands.  That is the true source of indurium.Send Fizzle Brassbolts my regards, and tell him what I told you.Safe travels, <name>.  And it won't surprise me if we meet again -- once Fizzle learns of indurium he'll probably send you to Uldaman to acquire it!"
1138,"I love crab.  Crabs are the fruit of the sea!  You can bake it, barbecue it, boil it, and broil it.  They're pan fried, deep fried, and stir fried.  There's crab salad, crab soup, crab stew, pepper crab, lemon crab, whipper root crab, and Ironforge surprise crab.  That's... that's about it.I'm here fishing right now, so I can't get any fine crab chunks.  You can pick them out of reef crawlers and encrusted tide crawlers.  You can make a lot with it.  You can bake it, barbecue it, boil it..."
1139,"We've slowed the Shadowforge clan by cutting them off from Blackrock Spire, but Hammertoe's quest is still unfulfilled. His death must not be in vain. He dreamt of finding the Tablet of Will: a stone shard inscribed with magic by the titans themselves to help imbue their creations with life--making them have a will of their own, or so the legends say.We must still recover the Tablet before the Shadowforge clan finds it.Return to Uldaman, find the tablet, and return here immediately."
1140,"The writing of the orcs is little better than the scribblings of a child. Many of my order scoffed when I chose to learn their tongue, but I have found it beneficial to gain further understanding of my enemies.From Ilkrud's scribblings, it appears that Athrikus still possesses two soulgems, and they are being held in Night Run and Satyrnaar, satyr-held areas in northeast Ashenvale.Be careful out there, <name>, the satyrs' blood-soaked temples can be unsettling even for a seasoned <class> such as yourself."
1141,"I love fishing.  The Blump family is known for fishing.  My name is Gubber Blump; I fish.There's a kind of fish I like to catch around these parts called Darkshore grouper.  I used to go out on a boat to fish for grouper, but no boats have been going out since them mean ol' murlocs moved in.  I bet they been eating up all the grouper too.Say, you wanna help me catch Darkshore grouper?  I'd give you a bona fide Blump Family Fishing Pole if you did!  It's a real good pole to catch fish with."
1142,"I have not long to live... so... so... weak....the b-b-brave dwarf, Lonebrow, has been sent to w-w-warn Falfindel...But before I... d-d-die......my wife, Treshala... her pendant of bonding to me... stolen... by one of the f-f-foul aggressors...Find it p-p-please... and return it to Treshala in Darnassus......along with w-w-word of my lonely... death."
1143,"I see. Well, if what you say is true, then now is the time to strike. I believe Athrikus resides at the top of the tower. Be careful though, he is surrounded by many powerful warlocks, much more deadly than the ones you faced before."
1144,"At last, help has arrived!You have no clue how long I've been held prisoner here. I can't remember the last time I saw the outside of this place.You see, I am an entrepreneur. Always out for a copper, as they say. I caught wind that Mebok Mizzyrix was paying well for Redleaf Tuber from this here pig pen. I figured it would be an easy in, easy out kind of affair. As you can see, I was a bit wrong!Anyway, if you'd be so kind as to help me get out of here, I'll make it worth your while."
1145,"Many travelers who've come through the Crossroads helped me gather eggs from the Field of Giants, and many of them have tales of how deadly the creatures are. I've heard enough to consider them insects a much larger threat than my masters first thought.I need a courier to travel to Orgrimmar to meet Belgrom Rockmaul. It be no simple matter, and someone who would take the task seriously should go.Belgrom usually be found outside the warriors' guild house."
1146,"So, Korran has come to a similar conclusion about these insects--they seem to be a larger threat than we assumed.A few days ago a hunter returned to me from Thousand Needles nearly dead. He was with a raiding party sent to drive a dwarven excavation team out of the Shimmering Flats. During the attack, more of these insects erupted from a cave in the dig site and nearly killed the party.They were led by Moktar Krin, and they've taken refuge on the border of the Shimmering Flats. Bring him this note."
1147,Hmm. Seems Belgrom thinks those monsters are a threat. He wants them pushed back into whatever depths they crawled up out of.I guess killing the dwarves sent by the Explorers' League wasn't enough--now I have to send a half-dead war party into another battle. We won't be able to do it ourselves; not while we're in this condition. The dig site's to the south of here. There shouldn't be anymore dwarves to deal with. Feel up to wielding a blade or staff and doing your part to aid us?
1148,"You inspect the carapace carefully. As you turn it over in your hands you realize that the chitinous plating is interlaced in such a way that makes it incredibly strong. It's unlike anything you've ever seen. You inspect the rest of the corpse further and realize that these creatures are very powerful and highly evolved.Looking down at the carapace again, you think that Korran would enjoy studying more of these creatures. It could help him figure out what these creatures are, and where they come from."
1149,"So, you have sought me out, or perhaps destiny brings you to me? No matter. You are here now, and so your journey will begin anew.Many facets make up a being: the spirit, the body, the mind. Some of these can be measured by a culture's traditions. Others we can only hope exist within ourselves. If you agree, I shall test some of the facets within you.If you pass, then you shall become stronger. If you fail, then you will realize the vastness of the Nether.The first is a Test of Faith."
1150,"I'm pleased to see your courage remains steadfast in light of what you've already done. Since your faith is intact, the time has come to test your body.First is a test of endurance. Go to the Roguefeather Den west of Freewind Post. Make your way to the depths of their lair and destroy their foodstuffs. By then you should have provoked their fury, and if you are able to survive long enough, Grenka Bloodscreech herself will come for you--kill her and bring me her claw to complete your test."
1151,"During the time of the Old Gods, elementals inhabited much of this world. They worshipped the Old Gods, and the Gods, through their power, kept the elementals bound to this world. When the Old Gods were banished, the elementals faded from our world and now only return at the bidding of powerful mages.There are exceptions though. Some elementals were powerful enough to remain here on their own. One such elemental is Rok'Alim.To test your strength, find Rok'Alim in Thousand Needles and slay him."
1152,"Your time with me is just about finished. I am knowledgeable, but the Test of Lore is not mine to give. There are lessons to be learned and places to visit that others claim domain over.If you are prepared, then seek out Braug Dimspirit--he is a shaman of great wisdom. He will test you further, so heed his words, <name>.When you are ready, find the tunnel that connects the Stonetalon Mountains with Ashenvale: Braug dwells near there. And be careful, <name>, the night elves may wish to impede your test."
1153,"<class>, you have done well in helping me in the past. The warchief is pleased thus far with what I've accomplished, and asks me to continue with renewed determination. My honor dictates that I give you proper recognition to the warchief for all you have done, but first I would ask you for your help again.Travelers recently came from the south from a place called Thousand Needles. There they killed a kobold who had an unusual ore sample, but they would not sell it. I want a sample of that ore to examine."
1154,"You have passed Dorn's tests, and now you seek to pass your next trial. Very good. But up until now, your challenges have been childish. It is easy to test your body--your mind is another matter completely.I shall explain it simply: find the book I name, study it, and answer my question about its contents.What book, you must be asking? The Legacy of the Aspects. It can be found at the bottom of Dor'danil in southern Ashenvale, protected by the dead druids and their slayers."
1159,"Well done, <name>. You have passed the first portion of the Test of Lore, but there is still another question to be answered. But that question is not mine to ask.Seek out Parqual Fintallas in Lordaeron City. He was a great historian for the humans before the Plague overtook him. Now he continues to seek enlightenment, but of a different nature.He will have another requirement of you before he asks you anything, but you have done masterfully thus far--I'm sure you will overcome his obstacle."
1160,"I will tell you what you must seek, and I will even ask you my question, but not because you wish to prove yourself. Knowledge is far more important than strength. Even as others seem to pass you by in ability, your knowledge of the world will be more valuable.Go to the Monastery in the north of Tirisfal Glades. In the library there, a book called Beginnings of the Undead Threat resides. It was used by the now-corrupt paladins there to train them to fight my kind.Bring it to me."
1164,"The harlot! The swine! Kenata still lives; her family healthy and prospering while I suffer. Forsaken indeed!My family is gone, taken by the plague. Our estate also forfeit; looted and burned during the war. And after all that, her and her lousy children had the audacity to steal the only precious belongings I had left.I don't care about the things they stole any more. What I want now are their heads!Kill them for me! Go to the Dabyrie Farmstead in Arathi, northeast of Refuge Point."
1166,"Bow before Overlord Mok'Morokk!Rexxar make me mighty leader of Stonemaul Clan!Me good leader. Me keep clan safe.Big dragons come and make fire at old home. Me smart ogre. Find new home for clan here.Leave old home so fast, me forget stuff. Tiny <race>, go get my things. Go south and find my yummy grog, my snuff and my strongbox. Me like you after you do that. You look in Den of Flame and Stonemaul Ruins... they be there, me sure!"
1167,"Before confronting Athrikus, it would probably be wise for you to consult with Balthule. I have no doubt he has been vigilant in his watch of the Tower, and he may have information about recent developments."
1168,Mok'Morokk was made Overlord by Rexxar. He care more for power than he care for ogres.Black dragons kill many ogre. Kill Tharg's wife. Mok'Morokk tell us to run. Make us come here.Ogre should fight. Ogres not good at running. Mok'Morokk care only about Mok'Morokk.Me call Stonemaul Ruins home. Me like it in the south. This place not home.Help ogres fight army of the black dragon. Me want revenge. Me want to go home.
1169,"Whilst that craven fool, Mok'Morokk, wallows in power and Tharg wrestles the demons of sorrow and vengeance and vies for leadership of the clan, I seem to be the only one concerned with identifying the source of aggression on our old home.Why the puzzled stare, <name>? Expecting me to speak like an uncouth ruffian merely because I am an ogre?Now back to business, bring to me the hearts and tongues from the whelps and hatchlings. I shall trace the root of this evil..."
1170,"Stonemaul Village was invaded by the brood of Onyxia. But why would the daughter of the black dragonlord, Deathwing, descend upon our lands?This is most troubling. Surely, Onyxia was driven here for a purpose beyond laying siege to a small band of ogres.Notify Mok'Morokk at once! Action must be taken."
1171,You leave me alone now. Go tell Draz'Zilb we stay here. No black dragon here.
1172,"Onyxia's brood has been scattered across the Dragonmurk. It is imperative that no more whelps be permitted to hatch.Make haste to Wyrmbog in the south of Dustwallow Marsh. Surely, she has made her lair there. Track down the evil dragon's eggs and destroy them.We will never reclaim Stonemaul Village if the surrounding area remains a breeding ground.As for Mok'Morokk... I have other plans for the sod."
1173,You dare challenge Overlord Mok'Morokk?Haw!Me crush tiny <race>!You tell me when ready for good beating.
1175,"After the big crash with the goblins' Red Thunder racer and a basilisk, Kronkrider hired me on to take care of the track. I don't know what all the animals out on the flats are feeding on to grow so big, but we have to be careful to thin them out so they won't wander onto the track when a race is going on.Tell you what. If you want to go out and make a little profit, go out and remove the basilisks from the area."
1176,"When it comes to racing, every bit counts! Whether it's a minor tweaking on the power output, a slight slackening on the tension coils, or lightening the weight of the frame, you have to take everything into account.We use vulture bones for a lot of the minor structural tweaks we make to our racers, which offer the perfect balance of strength and weight. Even better, it's easy for us to get more, as the salt flats are littered with vultures.Bring me some and I'll give you a good price on them."
1177,Mud big ogre.Me hungry.Go bash fishy. Bring Mud food.You feed Mud or Mud eat you.
1178,"Our racing team is the pride of goblins everywhere. You'd be surprised at some of the people who contribute in one way or another to our team.You know Gazlowe? He tracks down parts from around the world for us. He even came down to work on one of our rigs once!A few weeks ago, he said he'd send us a new prototype fuel regulator but it hasn't come yet. He's usually very prompt... Maybe you wouldn't mind going to Ratchet to ask him about it? I wouldn't be so pushy, but the gnomes are gaining on us!"
1179,"You ever heard of the Shimmering Flats?  It's a stretch of salt flats way over in Kalimdor, just south of the Thousand Needles canyon.  It's a great place for racing because, well, it's so flat!A couple of gnome brothers are out there, friends of mine, trying out their new rocket car, and from what I hear it's fast!  Heh, so fast that their pilots keep crashing.  Giving themselves concussions.So they asked me for some Siege Engine helmets, but I have duties here.  I can't make the trip!Can you?"
1180,"Back to what you came here about. I know I promised Pozzik that I'd deliver a new fuel regulator for him, but I still haven't received it yet. Revilgaz over in Booty Bay said he'd have it shipped over, but it might be it slipped through the cracks somehow.If that's true, there's not much we can do about it. We can at least find out if it was dispatched from Booty Bay.Check in with Wharfmaster Lozgil over there, he should be able to check the cargo records."
1181,"I'm afraid I can't be of much more help to you, <name>. If you'd like to follow up on it more, I'd suggest you go hit up the Baron himself. If there's anyone who knows Revilgaz's business, it's Revilgaz.You'll find him at the tavern across the harbor, top floor."
1182,"See, the Venture Company shredders out in Lake Nazferiti (in northern Stranglethorn) have been equipped with a new model fuel regulator. I was thinking that Pozzik would be able to take advantage of it, if he could get some details. Unfortunately, Cozzle, the foreman out there, appears to be a little more clever than I gave him credit for.You seem like you might have more luck finding the blueprints though. I know he keeps them in his house, but they're almost certainly under lock and key."
1183,"You should be all set to go. Give Pozzik my regards and tell him that if he ever needs anything, not to hesitate to ask. I'll be waiting for the news that he breaks the track record soon!"
1184,"Head back to Belgrom in Orgrimmar and tell him Moktar be doing his bidding well out in the Thousand Needles. Tell him also, that me studies progress, and I hope to be havin' learned more soon. That should please him greatly."
1186,"I'm going to be busy with working on integrating this new fuel regulator to our racer designs, but if you'd like to help out the team some more, talk to Razzeric. He's our pilot--well, our eighteenth pilot, to be exact--and he likes to add his own little modifications to the racers.He's a little off his rocker, though, so try not to act too surprised."
1187,"Pozzik's a great mechanic, I know that, but he's afraid to just load on the firepower and grab on for the ride. Not me, though.After Pozzik finishes with a racer, I take a little time to put my own modifications on--you know, loosening up the controls, removing parts of the frame, and adding more juice!I ordered a seaforium booster from Shreev at the Gizmorium in Gadgetzan, but apparently the zeppelin it was being sent on crashed in Dustwallow Marsh! I gotta have it, <name>!"
1188,"But wait, what's this? Shreev left the safety on. That will limit the amount of power I can draw from the booster at any time. I told him I wanted it off! This is no good.You have to take this to the Gadgetzan Gizmorium in the Tanaris Desert and have Shreev remove this."
1189,"There, I did what Razzeric wanted. Just tell him to be careful when he sets this off. If he makes the slightest mistake, he won't be moving forward, he'll just be a burnt spot on the track.Would be a shame, too, if that happened. Who knows if our nineteenth driver would be any good?"
1190,"The Brassbolts brothers have discovered a new building material, that's the only explanation that makes sense. Their cars have been operating faster than before, but their designs, and all the other data we've gathered from their runs is identical.What we do know, is that Rizzle Brassbolts has been focused on the plans for this new discovery almost constantly.Zamek can create a diversion for you, so that you can steal those plans from them."
1194,"Rizzle's schematics describe the process of the refinement of indurium ore. From his scrawls, it is apparent that indurium ore is being obtained from the dwarven excavation site of Uldaman in the Badlands.Much of the other notes relate to the heat resistant properties.Used as a paperweight for the plans is a hunk of what appears to be unrefined indurium ore."
1195,"The Galak centaur in the Thousand Needles are protecting an artifact from the time of the centaurs' creation.We would like to retrieve it, but we require a phial of water from one of the night elves' moonwells.To collect the water, you will first need to obtain one of the phials carried by the dryads near the Raynewood Retreat in the heart of Ashenvale Forest. There is a moonwell near the western bank of the Falfarren River, south of the main road, where you can fill the phial."
1196,Bring the filled phial to Rau Cliffrunner at the Freewind Post in southeastern Thousand Needles. You can get to the Thousand Needles by taking the Great Lift at the southern edge of the Barrens.I wouldn't be surprised if you can help us out further.
1197,"Using the water you brought, you will be able to temporarily douse the flame that holds the centaur relic. It will not work permanently, however, so you will have to be quick about it.You will find Splithoof Crag, the centaurs' stronghold, to the north of here. The flame is kept in Splithoof Hold, a heavily guarded part of the crag.Be careful, though, the Galak centaur have great numbers here, and will be rather reluctant to surrender something so dear to them."
1198,"Many rumors circulate these days about the union of the Twilight's Hammer and the naga in Blackfathom Deeps on the coasts of Ashenvale.My role here with the Argent Dawn is to collect as much information as I can, so we know when and where help is needed.It has been weeks now since I sent a scout to check on the activity at Blackfathom Deeps. Argent Guard Thaelrid has not yet reported back.My other scouts are preoccupied with pressing matters.Seek out and aid Thaelrid for me, <name>."
1199,Empowered by the ancient rites of the chaotic Old Gods the members of the Twilight's Hammer strive to bring about the return of their dark patrons and spread death and terror across the world.We believe that the Twilight's Hammer has allied with the naga and are amassing in Blackfathom Deeps on the coast of Ashenvale.Whatever evil plan brews in the depths of the old temple must be thwarted.Wage war on the Hammer and bring back proof of your deeds. Your efforts will be rewarded handsomely.
1200,"Strength has left me. Your help is needed!Long ago this site was a great temple of Elune. But misfortune led to ruin when the corruption of an Old God seeped up from beneath the earth and tainted the sacred Moon Well.Aku'Mai, servant of the Old God, rose from the waters.The Twilight's Hammer cultists have allied with the naga to occupy these grounds. The cultists, led by Kelris, sacrifice innocents to Aku'Mai for power.Slay Kelris and bring his head to Selgorm in Darnassus, <name>, please."
1201,"The Horde and Alliance hold an uneasy truce.  Outlying skirmishes and covert actions are taken by one side against the other, and it is our duty to ensure the Horde is on top!Now is the chance to do just that.Alliance infiltrators have taken positions east of Brackenwall Village.  They spy on the village and report our movements to Theramore, which we cannot allow.Hunt down the infiltrators and slay them.  Send a clear message to their superiors that we will not tolerate their spies' presence!"
1202,"<name>, two of our spies were sent to steal documents from a ship at the Theramore docks.  They gained the papers but were discovered, and were forced to throw the documents into the sea.One spy later escaped, but was unable to recover the prize.  He reported his failure to me, and I now charge the task to you.The documents are in a footlocker, in the waters somewhere beneath the Theramore docks.  Find those documents, <name>, and bring them to me."
1203,"I have cutting to do.  I can't tell you what I'm going to cut, but... I need myself a blade.  A certain blade...Some people call it a moonsteel broadsword.  I call it a swing blade.You help me?  Maybe you find it in town, maybe you talk to a blacksmith and he'll make it special.But don't sleep on this.  What I'm cutting won't keep forever..."
1204,"I'm working on a dish I call ""Mudrock Soup and Bugs.""  I still need the major ingredients, and... well, I don't think I'd last long trudging through Dustwallow Marsh!So, <name>, can you do some hunting for me?  First, I need the tongues of Mudrock turtles.  You can find Mudrocks along the coast, mostly around the bay.But I don't want just any tongues!  I hear that the tongues of some Mudrocks are forked...They say the forked tongues have a distinct flavor, and I want that flavor in my dish..."
1205,"Deadmire is an ancient crocolisk in Dustwallow marsh.  And it is his time to die.Old bones grind as he pulls his huge body through the swamp, and although he still moves with the strength and speed of youth, his aging body tortures the great spirit within it, a spirit whose flame will not waver.Yet now he lives in constant, maddening pain.  You must end the life of this noble creature, <name>.  You must lead Deadmire to peace."
1206,"Eye juice is good juice for drinking.  Too bad most critters only have two eyes.But spiders have lots of eyes.  Lots and lots.  And Darkmist eye juice is tasty.  Smooth and salty!  Unpopped spider eyes... I taste them already.Darkmist spiders are west of here, in the Darkmist Cavern.  You figure the spiders are named after the cave... or is it the other way around?"
1218,"I like cooking.  Good swamp cooking.  Fried green frog legs and the like.And for cooking, I need spice.  Soothing spice.  Then I'll make a stew and stew it up and suck it down and give you some too.Do you like stew?"
1219,"Sifting through the loose dirt, the severed hand of an orc is found.  And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube.  And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment.The parchment is written in orcish... and it looks important."
1220,"Captain Vimes should see the orc report you found, <name>.  He knows the orcish language better than most.  And he should know that there are Horde spies near Theramore!The captain is in the barracks, on the northeastern side of Theramore Isle."
1221,"Blueleaf tubers are a delicacy around the world!  But they're rare, very rare.  The only place to find them is here in the Barrens, deep in the earth, in Razorfen Kraul.And even then, they're impossible to find unless you know just where to look!  That's why I've trained these snufflenose gophers to find them for me.  They have great noses and can smell a tuber from fifty paces away.It won't be easy, but if you get me some tubers I'll pay you handsomely."
1222,"Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me!I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, <buddy/lady>.The cook Morgan Stern is researching a new recipe, and he sent me out here to gather bogbean leaves.  I guess he thinks they're tasty.Anyway, while looking for a bogbean plant... I got myself surrounded!  Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for the bogbean?"
1238,"Sifting through the loose dirt, the severed hand of an orc is found.  And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube.  And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment.The parchment is a report made by an orc who spent weeks spying on the city of Theramore.After scanning the parchment, it is clear that it must be brought to the orc spymaster in Brackenwall Village."
1239,"Vigorous digging reveals the head of a male orc, raggedly severed at the neck.  His lips are frozen in a snarl, and its dark eyes stare defiantly."
1240,"We must know the events surrounding Marg's death!  And the only way to do that, <name>, is through the witch-magic of trolls.Bring Marg's head to Kin'weelay in Stranglethorn Vale, at the Grom'gol Base Camp.Kin'weelay is the most powerful witchdoctor of the Darkspear trolls.  If anyone can speak to Marg Nighteye's spirit, it is he."
1241,"Recently a diplomat was sent to Theramore to meet with Jaina Proudmoore. That diplomat never arrived.I believe the Defias are involved in this plot, but I'm not sure how. The diplomat's disappearance still eludes public attention, but it can't remain that way for long.Agents of the king are already scouring the city for clues, but I have my own contacts I would like involved.In the Valley of Heroes is an old friend of mine named Jorgen. Find him, give him this note, and follow his instructions."
1242,"Take this here note to Elling Trias. Don't say nothin' else to him. Just be polite and wait for him to respond. And don't worry, he will.I'm gonna only impress this on ya once more, <name>: treat this matter seriously, and keep your yapper shut.Ya can find Trias at his cheese shop, Trias' Cheese, in the Trade District. Good luck."
1243,"Jorgen, you ol' sonuva.... So, that's how it's going to be, huh?All right, I can deal with that. I hope he finds the Twisting Nether that much sooner!Here's what's gonna happen, <name>. I'll start using my contacts here, but you're doing most of the footwork so I save some coin.Head to Darkshire in Duskwood and find Watcher Backus--he usually patrols the north road right outside of town. Just tell him you're looking into any Defias activity for me and he'll help you out with any information he can."
1244,"Defias activity? Well, there's always some activity; even if they keep to themselves we consider them a threat.But now that I think about it, there was a recent sighting that seemed odd. It must have been a couple weeks ago, but some of their agents had gathered around Addle's Stead. From the report, I'd guessed something big went down.Why don't you check there first and bring me back anything you find?The farmstead is south of the road from Westfall just as you enter Duskwood."
1245,"Whoa, this looks way too complex to be something to just lead you astray. I shouldn't even be looking at this stuff. Take it to Trias--he'll be able to make sense of it. And DON'T let anyone get in your way. This is bigger than me. It might even be bigger than him, but we'll see.And do me a favor, <name>, don't tell anyone I helped you. If my superiors found out I knew about any of this and didn't share it with them they'd probably hang me."
1246,"Yeah, now that I think about it... Dashel... Dashel something... What was his name? FIST! Dashel Stonefist. They call him Fist in some circles--probably on account that he likes to get in brawls.You can find him in Old Town usually--right smack dab in the center of it. Go talk to him. If you have to, use a sword or something heavy and blunt to persuade him to open up some. And don't hesitate. If he's in this as deep as these papers suggest, then he's not going to give you any information willingly."
1247,So yeah... um... I might know something 'bout that meeting at Addle's Stead. Happened a few weeks back I think. I really didn't have any part in it. Me part was done when plan A failed... damn adventurers.The guy we got on the inside for plan B came out of Menethil; guy called Slim. That's all I know regarding their backup plan.
1248,"A contact of mine retired in the Wetlands at the harbor city of Menethil. He should be willing to help on your word alone if you tell him you're working for me. His name is Mikhail. He mentioned becoming a bartender before leaving Stormwind a few years ago.Speak to him, find this Slim, and find out if there's anything else to know about this kidnapped diplomat. We need to find out where they've taken him, or at least who he is. The docket doesn't mention anything about their plans after he's captured."
1249,"You say Elling sent you here? Well then, the hospitality I expressed is now tenfold. Anything you need, just ask. I will do my best to aid you.Hmm, Slim, you say? Not sure the name sounds familiar, but I'll keep my eyes out for him.Don't look now, <name>, but the gentleman over by the exit is looking over here. He's listening to our conversation a little too intently if you catch my meaning? If I were you, I'd do what you can to subdue him before he makes a break for the door."
1250,"The Defias didn't pay me well enough to die for their cause. They took the king. Yeah, the king of Stormwind, not some lowly diplomat. He was on his way to Theramore to meet with Jaina Proudmore--it was a big deal apparently, and a big secret. But it's not just the Defias that are involved. They're working with someone. I think they knew this was bigger than them.My part was just to get their man on board the king's ship while it was in the harbor. The guy's name was Hendel. That's all I know. I swear!"
1251,"An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of the few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the Shady Rest Inn.The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney."
1252,"A glint of light on the ground catches your eye from underneath the rubble. Brushing away debris and ash caked onto the object reveals the insignia of a gold anchor on white enameled on the surface: the sign of Theramore.Underneath the anchor is embossed the name ""Lieutenant Paval Reethe""."
1253,"An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of the few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the Shady Rest Inn.The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney."
1258,"Another component of my new recipe is the shelled leg of a giant crab.  And the crabs they have in Dustwallow -- Muckshells they call them -- just won't do!  I'm afraid the only suitable crabs live far away, in the Swamp of Sorrows.The shell of the crab leg is a key element of the dish's presentation so I need pristine, unscarred legs.  An adult crab might only have one or two such legs, and I need a lot in order to research my dish.So, <name>... are you willing to travel?"
1259,"I don't recognize the name of Lieutenant Paval Reethe. Your best bet would be to check with Adjutant Tesoran. He keeps track of all the records for the Theramore guard, from personnel to their equipment.He should be able to tell you who this Reethe is with a quick check of his books."
1260,"I'm developing a new menu for the restaurant.  It will be filled with rural dishes with a ""bayou"" theme.  I think my clientele at the Blue Recluse will love them!I sent my nephew Morgan to Theramore, a city on the edge of the Dustwallow Marsh.  He's there gathering recipes from the locals, and I must know what he found so far.The trip to Theramore is long.  Too long for me.  But I bet a young <class> like yourself would jump at the chance to travel, yes?"
1261,"Cursed muckshell!  You can't kill Marg!  Ah, but I am dead.  So it must have slain me...But my mission!  My mission!  You, <name>, must complete it.While near Theramore, I spied a group of Alliance soldiers camped on the beach.  And one soldier wore a pendant... a pendant laden with more gems than any soldier could afford!That night I snuck into their camp and stole the pendant, but on my return to base a muckshell crab-man killed me!<name>, you must find that muckshell and recover the pendant!"
1262,"It is strange that the pendant Marg stole was in the hands of common soldiers.  Perhaps its owner was in disguise, or perhaps the soldiers themselves stole it!Regardless of which is true, this is a noble's pendant and we must discover its true owner if we are to unravel its mystery.Take the pendant to Zor Lonetree in Orgrimmar.  He is well schooled in Alliance politics, and will know if this pendant has a history among the nobles of Stormwind."
1264,"The beginning of every month the Kul Tiras Marines all get paid and usually leave Theramore for somewhere else. A lot of them come here to womanize, carouse, and just have a good time. One of those groups I'd consider regulars here at the tavern, and I believe this Hendel is among them.Commander Samaul in Theramore would be able to help you find him if Hendel's still stationed there. He's completely loyal to Proudmoore, but if you drop Elling's name, he should help you out... discreetly."
1265,"Hendel? Yes, I know the man. But why would you need one of my soldiers?Elling sent you to find him? Hmm, I don't like the sound of that. Elling wouldn't have you come to me first if your business wasn't troubling. I understand if you can't tell me what this is about, but know this: I have a duty to protect these lands. If you're going to cause a disturbance, then I suggest you inform me of whatever you can.I believe Hendel was stationed at the first tower outside of Theramore. Be cautious."
1266,"Private Hendel is to the west of here. He's currently on guard duty protecting some of Theramore's infiltrators while they rest. They've been keeping tabs on the Horde base, Brackenwall, and looking for anything else that might threaten our borders.You should have no problem finding him; just look for the tents along the road.I have another matter to attend to, but I shall catch up to you soon enough. You can always find me in the Lady Proudmoore's tower if you have any problems."
1268,"Rows of hoofprints lead away from the still-smoking skeleton of the Shady Rest Inn. There are at least a few visible impressions, with more rows of prints almost imperceptible in the soft mud of the marsh."
1269,"A glint of light on the ground catches your eye from underneath the rubble. Brushing debris and ash caked onto the object reveals the insignia of a gold anchor on white, enameled on the surface: the sign of Theramore.Underneath the anchor is embossed the name ""Lieutenant Paval Reethe""."
1270,"Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me!!I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, <buddy/lady>.A goblin from Ratchet named Mebok Mizzyrix needs some bogbean leaves for a potion, or something... I honestly don't care why -- his money was good and I know this swamp, so here I am.Too bad I got myself surrounded before I found the bogbean!  Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for Mebok's plant?"
1273,"It took a long time, but I found Reethe. He hide good for a human.Ogron worried that he might be crazy after so much time in swamp. You come with me for we go get answers from him."
1274,"Excuse me, < sir / madam>. Bishop DeLavey asked me to approach adventurers that might be able to help him with a delicate matter.If you could quietly head to Stormwind Keep and speak to him at your earliest convenience, I'm sure he would appreciate your help. Again, please be discreet. It is a matter of some importance."
1275,"Foolish blood elves toil with demonic magic. Have they not witnessed what happened with the naga and with the satyrs of Kalimdor?I fear that the blood elves will meet a similar deformation. Azeroth cannot afford to give birth to another vile race of monsters.I wish to study the brain stems of the satyr and naga so that I might deduce what fate the elves are headed toward. In Blackfathom Deeps, on the coast of Ashenvale, you will find both satyr and naga.'Tis a long journey, <name>."
1276,"Ah, I remember now! Mosarn is a well-respected blacksmith in Thunder Bluff. I knew I had heard his name somewhere, before.In thanks, the Earthen Ring awarded me with a set of armor crafted by Mosarn. Very good work.Perhaps he can tell you more about the shield he crafted.It's not much of a lead, but since we didn't get anything useful out of Reethe, it's all we have."
1282,"I can't help it if I feel sorry for ol' Jim there. He wasn't always like that. Ran an inn out in the marsh for a while, wonderful place.Look, I don't really want to talk about it. Bring it up with Captain Vimes if you really have to. He's stationed on the top floor of Foothold Citadel, the large barracks to the east of Lady Jaina's tower."
1284,"Rows of hoofprints lead away from the still-smoking skeleton of the Shady Rest Inn. There are at least a few visible impressions, with more rows of prints almost imperceptible in the soft mud of the marsh."
1285,"Reddon... Redpath... Ah, here it is! Lieutenant Paval Reethe.Joined the Theramore guard along with most of the recruits that came across the sea with Lady Proudmoore. Enlisted with the marines of Kul Tiras at the age of sixteen. Distinguished service, promotions...Listed as missing."
1286,"It has been a struggle maintaining a presence in the marsh, but through strength of our resolve, we have been able to maintain several defensive watchtowers throughout the area.The latest information and scouting reports I have received indicate that a group of deserters has squatted in our abandoned tower at Lost Point, southeast of the inn.The local lieutenant seems to be Balos Jacken. See if you can get some information out of him.Be warned, <name>. He may be a tough nut to crack."
1287,"Reethe? That coward?We threw him out of camp because he insisted on raiding the supplies of the ogres up at Brackenwall Village. We're not so many in number that we could stand up to those mindless brutes.He crossed the line one too many times, so we left him to fend for himself.Now, I helped you out... So, why don't you help us out and forget you bumped into us?"
1301,"Before working here at the Blue Recluse, I was trained by one of the best chefs and innkeepers I'd ever met. His name was James Hyal. Everything I have and everywhere I've gotten in life is thanks to him.I wonder how he's doing. His brother Vincent and he went to work in a tavern in Menethil Harbor, but I haven't heard from him recently.If you ever happen to be headed in that direction, maybe you could say hello to him for me?"
1302,"My brother James went with Lady Proudmoore across the sea. Last I heard, the fighting had settled down over there, and James was setting up an inn somewhere on the continent. Wherever he is, I'm sure he's doing good business. Damn fine cook he was.I haven't heard from him for a while now--too busy with his inn, I'd wager--but the clerk in Theramore could probably point you to him. Look for him on the top floor of that keep near the middle of the city. What's it called... Foothold Citadel, that's it."
1318,"Now you da king, so maybe you get prized Gordok artifact back from creepy elf who calls himself Prince!  Da king before you failed, just like all da other kings since Tortheldrin - da creepy elf - stole it from old timey Gordok king!Artifact is called da Gauntlet of Gordok Might.  Old timey stories say only da one true king da Gordok can get it back.  Old timey story also say creepy elf is still around here - you find it and it will become mighty gauntlet you wear forever!  Yar, I show you!"
1319,"I'm sorry I can't be of much help, <name>, but I can refer you to someone who would be. Caz Twosprocket, one of our best blacksmiths, works the forge at the smithy.Take the shield to him, and see what he can tell you."
1320,"Ah, I almost missed this... The leather strap on the back must have burned off, but it seems like it was made to fit a large person. I'd guess a tauren, actually.That's about all I can tell you. Tell Captain Vimes I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help."
1321,"Hmm... I don't see anything out of the ordinary with this shield. We should have Do'gol, the blacksmith, take a look at it, and see if he can tell us more about it, but I wouldn't hold out hope..."
1322,"Hmmm, there's writing right here on the rim of the shield, but it's hard to read from all the burned stuff.I need acid to make it clear. Venom from the Darkfang spiders in the marsh would do good. Get me some of their sacs and I can clean this up."
1323,"Oh, I think I might have dropped too much acid onto the shield. Let me just rub a little...Hm, kind of hard to read, but it looks like the name Mosarn. Never heard of him. Maybe Krog knows. Krog knows many people."
1324,"What?! You come here accusing me of allying with the Defias, and think I'll just stand here while you insult me?! Something tells me you've had this coming for a long time."
1338,"There is a dwarven armorsmith whose work I admire greatly.  His name is Furen Longbeard, and his skill is unmatched.  I need a new shield, and I must have one of his!The problem is... Furen is far to the south, in the dwarven district within Stormwind.  In human lands!  I can't imagine why he would live there, so far from Ironforge.  The humans must pay him a king's ransom to keep him there!So, if you want to travel and don't mind making some money, then will you send Furen my request for a shield?"
1339,"I hear Mountaineer Stormpike is looking for a runner.  Someone to do a little traveling for him.  How about it?  Are you the <race> for the job?If so, then you'll find Stormpike at the top of the northern guard tower."
1358,"A colleague in Kalimdor, Apothecary Helbrim, is researching the effects of Lordaeron toxins on the beasts of Kalimdor.  He would be very interested in a sample of the wolf hearts Renferrel sent me.Helbrim is stationed in the Barrens, in a village known as the Crossroads.  To reach him, you must travel via zeppelin to the orc capital of Orgrimmar, then travel south, by foot, to Durotar.  Head west into the Barrens, and you will soon reach the Crossroads."
1359,"The wolf hearts you acquired possess a quality unseen in similar specimens.  There is a toxicity to them that should be deadly to the very wolves in which the hearts beat!It's quite incredible, and we must study it further.  I kept a few samples of the hearts acquired.  Take them to my colleague, Apothecary Zinge.  You will find her in our headquarters in the Undercity."
1360,"I had myself a fine job as a digger at the Uldaman excavation site in the Badlands... that is until those blasted troggs showed up.  I escaped with my hide barely intact, and nothing else.  In the chaos, I left my most treasured possession.  It's safe from the troggs in my chest, sure, but it's right in the thick of 'em.I'd be in your debt, both in honor and coin, if you could fetch it for me!  A chest with my name on it is at the end of the North Common Hall.  That's the one you need to get in."
1361,"A warrior of the Horde, Regthar Deathgate, is recruiting agents for a mission into the land of Desolace.  Speak with him if you wish to volunteer.  He is stationed in the Barrens, in a series of bunkers west of the Crossroads.And sharpen your weapons.  Desolace is a place torn by war."
1362,"The Kolkar centaur live in Desolace, and their forces have spread into the Barrens.  This is a known fact and we have Horde agents dealing with them here.But as long as the centaur are strong in Desolace, they will always pose a threat.  It is time we rid ourselves of that threat.Speak with Felgur Twocuts at Ghost Walker Post in Desolace.  He was sent to gather intelligence on the centaur.  He will know how to best deal with the Kolkar of Desolace."
1363,"As caretaker of the works here in the library of the Academy of Arcane Arts and Sciences, it is my responsibility to ensure all the magical tomes and scrolls are accounted for at all times. Who knows what folly would unfold if some of these enchanted texts were to fall into the wrong hands?Which reminds me... my assistant, Dellis, made a horrible mistake last week. He's quite able in the library but incompetent when he leaves the gates of Stormwind. Be a hero, and help old Dellis out, would you?"
1364,"Master Mazen's directions were quite clear: Deliver a very important essay to Watcher Mahar Ba in Nethergarde Keep.But I had never been to the Blasted Lands before! The journey was frightening!When I got to the Swamp of Sorrows, I made a wrong turn and ended up surrounded by horrible plant-like swamp creatures. They lurched as if to attack me so I ran. But in my haste I dropped the essay. One of the beasts took it I am sure.Could you please try to retrieve it and deliver it to Mahar Ba?"
1365,"The Kolkar are not the only centaur of Desolace.  Many clans wander these dry plains, fighting and dying against each other.  And it is good that they fight among themselves, for they are strong and brutal.  If the centaur united against us, they would be a fierce foe.We must deal with them before they unite.Your first task is to disrupt the Kolkar clan.  Do this by killing its leader, Khan Dez'hepah.The Kolkar Village is northeast of here.  Go, and may fortune go with you."
1366,"Now that you scared the centaur clans, it's time to bleed them.  When traveling Desolace, hunt centaur.  I don't care which clan you hunt.  Just gather ears.  A hoard of ears.By weakening their numbers you will weaken their resolve, and stamp out any thoughts of expansion.Good hunting, <name>."
1367,"To beat the centaur, we must use their hatred against them.  We will ally with one of the clans and through them, we will learn how to defeat all the clans.If you choose to ally with the Magram then slay their foes, the Gelkis.  This will earn you respect among the Magram.  When you earn enough, then meet with the Magram spokesman Warug, on the outskirts of the Magram Village, in southeast Desolace."
1368,"To beat the centaur, we must use their hatred against them.  We will ally with one of the clans and through them, we will learn how to defeat all the clans.If you choose to ally with the Gelkis then slay their most hated rival, the Magram.  After you earn the respect of the Gelkis, meet with the Gelkis shaman Uthek the Wise, on the outskirts of the Gelkis Village, in southwest Desolace."
1369,"The Gelkis think our centaur mother, Theradras, protects us.  They are stupid.  No one protects the centaur.  The Magram do not need protection!  We are the strongest!Show the Gelkis they are stupid.  Go to the cave in their village.  They hoard crystals in that cave, the tears of Theradras.  Destroy the tears and bring me the broken pieces!"
1370,"When we are not at war, we hunt for meat.  Meat gives us strength, and full bellies fight harder than empty ones.It is the same with the Magram.  They store extra meat so they may fight longer between hunts.  If you raid their village to the east and take their stores of meat, then their strength will fail."
1371,"Long ago, a little gnome came to Desolace.  He had horses and a cart, and the cart held strange things.  Funny things.  Things that burned different colors.  Things that moved and weren't alive.  I killed the little gnome, but before that... he made me laugh.I kept my favorite thing from his cart.  It was a human made of wood and it waved at me until I hit it and broke it.I want a new one.  Get me a new one!"
1372,"Our expeditionary force was sent at Varimathras's behest to survey lower Azeroth.While out scouting I noticed a human Infiltrator spying on Beggar's Haunt. Before I could apprehend him, some of our orcish... brethren... captured him and took him to Stonard, their stronghold in Swamp of Sorrows.I want to... help... our orcish allies. They did not see our camp here but nonetheless I want to lend a hand.Work with Faustin here to develop a... truth serum for our friend in Stonard."
1373,"You have more to prove, and your next task will take you far, so for now the Gelkis will fight the Magram without you.The earth whispers many secrets to those who listen.  One secret I hear is of a red crystal.  It is called draenethyst, and it is new to our earth.  It comes from a place where mountains fly, and where demons rule.Bring me a shard of draenethyst, and it will make my magic strong!  The shard is in a place called the Swamp of Sorrows, held by the lost one Ongeku."
1374,"The earth speaks to me, and it says that the Magram grow weak.  Now it is time to kill their Khan!Bring me the head of the Magram Khan, Jehn!"
1375,"You help the Magram, and I like you.  Now, kill the Khan of the Gelkis!  He is Khan Shaka, and I want his head!  I want to stare at his head and laugh at him!"
1380,"<name>, you helped us against the Magram.  Now, help us beat the Maraudine!  Kill the head of their clan, Khan Hratha!To face him, blow the Maraudine War Horn.  It is atop a high bluff in the Valley of Spears.But to blow the horn, you must gain a warhorn mouthpiece.  These are rare, carried only by trusted Maraudine centaur.After the horn is blown, centaur will come.  Kill them until Hratha appears.Khan Hratha holds the piece of... a key.  Bring it to me..."
1381,"The Gelkis Khan is dead, and now the Maraudine will fall!  Kill the Maraudine Khan, Hratha!To face him, blow the horn on the high bluff in the Valley of Spears.  But to blow the horn, you need a mouthpiece.  To get a mouthpiece, kill Maraudine centaur.  Keep killing until you find a mouthpiece.  Then blow the horn.Do this and Maraudine centaur will come to the tower.  Kill them until Khan Hratha appears.  Hratha holds the piece of a key.  Give this piece to me..."
1382,"We are fortunate the centaur clans fight among themselves, for if they joined into a single force then they would be unstoppable.  Yes, we are fortunate, and we should press our advantage.One of the centaur clans, the Gelkis clan, is in brutal war with the Magram clan.  If we attack the Magram, then perhaps an alliance may be struck with the Gelkis.Speak with Uthek the Wise, in the outskirts of the Gelkis camps in southwestern Desolace.  Through her we might strike an alliance with the Gelkis."
1383,"I have just the right serum in mind. It will deal with the truth in precisely the way the truth should be dealt with.For this concoction I will need several Shadow Panther hearts from the Swamp. I also require the enchanted fungus off of the Mire Lord who resides there. I am sure one as able as you, <name>, can persuade him to part with some.Now the hard part will be locating a Deepstrider tumor from far-off Desolace. Very rarely the giants there become ill and a tumor forms.Now, off you go!"
1384,The Kolkar centaurs think their magic is strong.  They do not know magic!  They would not know magic if it bit them!You will show them their magic is weak.  Go to the Kolkar  to the northeast and kill them.  Take their charms.  Bring me the charms and I will throw them in the fire and laugh!
1385,"Desolace is a land at war.  The centaurs wage war with each other, and we believe the victor among them will spill out and threaten our strongholds.  That, we cannot allowWe must learn how to beat the centaurs, and to do that... we must ally with one of the clans.  The Magram centaurs war with the Gelkis.  If you fight the Gelkis then the Magram might consider an alliance.Earn the favor of the Magrams then speak with Warug, in the Magram village in southeastern Desolace."
1386,"The Kolkar think they are strong, but we laugh at them!  We laugh and we kill them!  You kill them too.  Show me you can kill Kolkar like we do. Head north and slay them all!"
1387,"Many clans make up the centaur race.  Each has its own leader and agenda, but all the clans have one thing in common.  Cruelty.If we are to ever find peace, then the centaurs must be removed.  And so I put you on the task to do just that.While wandering Desolace, hunt centaur and take their ears.  Bring me many, many ears.Do this in service of the Alliance, <name>, and we will be one step closer to war's end."
1388,"Everything is proceeding according to plan, <name>. I want you to give this truth serum to Deathstalker Zraedus and he'll show you how to administer it.... properly.Haha!"
1389,"The lost ones who live in the Fallow Sanctuary look as we look, but they are monsters... driven mad by the rigors of our journey to Azeroth.  Once our brethren, they now live in the Fallow Sanctuary to the east, catching or killing any who wander near.And they have stolen something sacred to us--draenethyst crystals.We lack the force to enter the Fallow Sanctuary and reclaim our stolen draenethyst from among their huts and campfires, but without those crystals... we too may lose our way."
1391,"We need to operate with a certain amount of discretion. After all, it's not like you're going to waltz in there and convince the fool to drink Faustin's concoction here, right?But if there's one thing those humans cannot deny it's the booze. I'll take Faustin's serum and mix it into this ale. I guarantee the poor sap will show no reluctance when it comes to chug-a-lugging a brew.Make haste to Stonard in the Swamp of Sorrows, <name>. And keep our little mission nice and quiet..."
1392,"Noboru has plagued the Draenei of the Harborage for months, and his cudgel is a symbol of the brutality they have suffered at the hands of the lost ones."
1393,"Please help!  These creatures are going to eat me!Help me out of here, and I'll give you a great treasure!  It's in my camp in the swamp north of Stonard, but it's locked in a strongbox that can be opened through a trick that only I know.If you help me escape, then I'll teach it to you."
1394,"You have done well, <name>. You have passed my test, and the tests before mine. Return to Dorn in Thousand Needles. He will sense the change within you, and see that your mind, body and spirit are strong enough that you should be rewarded for your efforts.Stay true to the balance you've shown throughout these trials, <name>. Dorn will test you again in the future if you do."
1395,"This crate of powerstones needs to go to Nethergarde Keep, in the Blasted Lands.  They won't hold their power for long, so we can't ship them with the next caravan.You must take them, and you must take them quickly.Bring them to Quartermaster Lungertz in Nethergarde Keep.  To reach the keep, you must travel east through Deadwind Pass, then east through the Swamp of Sorrows, then south through the Blasted Lands.Use caution, <name>.  You will travel through dangerous lands, yet you must not fail."
1396,"My caravan was destined for the eastern coast, but we did not reach our goal.  Lost Ones attacked us, killing guards and dashing supplies.I alone survived their assault.  I have sworn to protect what supplies remain, but wild creatures skulk near.  Please, help me defend my camp from the beasts!"
1398,"I owe you greatly, <name>.  An honorable heart beats within you.  And now I have another task for which I humbly ask your aid.If I'm ever to reach Nethergarde, then I must fix this wagon.  And for that... I will need wood.  Strong, dry wood--not the spongy, tangled wood of the swamp's trees.<name>, go east to the coast and search for driftwood that has been dried by the sun.  Bring it to me."
1418,"The Badlands is harsh and lies close to the Alliance-held land of Loch Modan, so communication between Stonard and the Badlands outpost of Kargath is often cut.Prove yourself, <name>.  Travel to the Badlands and speak with Neeka Bloodscar, head scout of the Kargath outpost.  Speak with her, and then send her report back to me."
1419,"Have you spent many days in the Badlands, <class>?  Have you felt its heat? Have you faced the beasts that wander its dusty plains?  It's time you did.Crag coyotes are a tough breed.  Tough, and bold enough to creep into Kargath and steal from our food supplies.  Help rid the outpost of these thieves!Hunt crag coyotes, <name>.  Hunt them and bring me their jawbones.  Bring me enough, and maybe I'll believe it when you say you know the Badlands."
1420,"I wrote a fresh report for Helgrum in Stonard.  Bring it to him.And if you consider yourself an outrunner, then don't lose your way.  Or fall to an enemy."
1421,"I was stunned during the attack by the Lost Ones, but before my sight went black I spied one of our wagons being dragged to the Fallow Sanctuary, the lost one village to the north.A caravan chest with valuable reagents was in that wagon, reagents vital to the studies of the wizards of Nethergarde Keep.  Find the chest and get those reagents, <name>.  Get them and bring them to me."
1422,"While I begin work on your weapon, why don't you talk to Katar? He mentioned needing help with patrols along the beach, and I'd rather see you keep your wits and weapons prepared instead of getting drunk with some of the other louses I share this camp with."
1423,"This barrel is small yet sturdy.  Its seams are sealed with a yellow, pungent wax.  Stamped on the bottom of the barrel are the words:QUARTERMASTER LUNGERTZNETHERGARDE KEEP"
1424,"The Warchief sent us to investigate strange happenings at The Temple of Atal'Hakkar.The Atal'ai trolls are a tribe of dark casters, known for practicing forbidden magic. You can imagine how astonished we were when we arrived here to discover the temple had been sunk.The green dragons now guard the site, claiming to be protectors of Azeroth.We need to discover what happened. Explore around the Pool of Tears and gather Atal'ai artifacts. From those I can begin to piece together this puzzle."
1425,"While I fix this wagon, <name>, I have one last task for you.I have packed the most vital supplies saved from the ogre attacks.  Take them to Nethergarde Keep.  The keep is nestled in the northern hills of the Blasted Lands, keeping watch over the Dark Portal.To reach Nethergard, follow the road east.  When it branches head south into the Blasted Lands, then turn left at the next fork.  Follow the road, <name>, and be wary."
1426,"I have no love for the sea, nor any creature I've seen come from its depths. It is a powerful but blind mistress; callous and brutal. It would bring me great pleasure to slay the fish men by the hundreds if it were within my power. But I garner some pleasure from watching their deaths at the hands of any who do the Horde's will.Which brings us to you, <class>. How many can you slay? Would you test yourself against their most powerful kind?"
1427,"Before you take rest, speak to Tok'Kar again. While you were gone I believe he finished a few weapons. For your help here, he would offer one of them to you. You would do well to test its strength against the fish men when you are ready... but only to please me further."
1428,"It pleases me to see your hatred for the fish men grows with mine.Find more of their kind along the beach, and when you've had your fill of combat, return to me. We shall speak then of a reward for your diligence."
1429,"While you were braving the dangers of the Pool of Tears, one of my scouts returned with a scroll written in blood on dried flesh. It seems to be a judicial sentence against a priest of the Atal'ai tribe.This priest was sentenced to a fate worse than death amongst the Atal'ai.He was exiled to live far north in the Hinterlands, with the Witherbark trolls.I will bundle these artifacts. You are to seek out the exile and discover their true use. Return to me once your journey is complete."
1430,"There's a high demand for the succulent taste of crawler meat among my customers; especially the meat from the monstrous crawlers.If you plan on heading to the coast, then I could easily make it worth your while to bring me back some of their legs to have transported back to Orgrimmar.The coast is to the east from here, and you should have no problem finding the creatures scurrying along the beaches and under the sea."
1431,"Be still, <class>, and allow me to share with you something important to our people, but far from obvious.We are a proud race, and the war with the humans tried even Thrall's great patience. You see, our Warchief is wise and prudent, and he continues to put his people first. Ultimately, he is a diplomat, and in his time with the humans he learned much of their ways.If the tale I've started piques your interest, then find Keldran near the western exit of the city. His hovel is there."
1432,"As the Alliance progresses deeper and deeper into Kalimdor, incorrect conclusions may be drawn about the Horde making pacts with the Burning Legion. The Warchief cannot allow that to happen. And with his blessing, I am taking control of overseeing them removed.I have agents in the area of Desolace at the Ghost Walker Post north of the great Kodo Graveyard. Head south of the Charred Vale in the Stonetalon Mountains and you shall come across it. When you arrive, seek out Takata Steelblade."
1433,"The Burning Blade have many agendas, but know that they are evil to their core, their spirits corrupted, and their destruction is the only way to thwart their objectives.Keldran sent Maurin with me because of his knowledge of the Blade and their warlock ways.He has control of our plots against the Blade while I deal with the other demonic threats here in Desolace.Speak to him, and he will guide you in his designs."
1434,"A demon infestation does not occur without other influences--something else allows evil to gain a foothold.It may start with a weakened spirit, a needless desire for power; perhaps it's a thirst for revenge, or the appeal for final justice. When we are beset by pain, evil takes advantage of us--evil such as the satyr.Ties have been made between them and the Burning Blade, and Thrall would have them slain. Seek them out to the northeast of here, and return to me when you've driven them back."
1435,"Death is most desirable for those despicable creatures that turn their back on their liege for such selfish reasons. But death is not enough when dealing with those that have given themselves over to the darkness.Take this gem. When one of the Burning Blade's near death, activate its magic. The spell shall pull the corrupted spirit out of its victim, leaving an infused gem behind.Bring me these infused gems so I may dispose of them properly.Go now, and may you elude death."
1436,"The fight goes well, <name>. Perhaps the Warchief will allow us to return to our homes before the seasons change if we continue to make such great strides in our battle against the demons and their underlings.Return to Keldran and let him know what we have done. I am sure he will reward you for your efforts here. His cause is important to him, and he will take pride in knowing that the Warchief respects his concerns."
1437,"I am Vahlarriel, <name>. I've come here to discover the whereabouts of two missing nobles of a Darnassian merchant family--House Malem. The father of the house fears the worst, and I am to do everything I can to find his missing children. I have yet to start my search for Tyranis or Dalinda, but I am hopeful I shall not be here long.Last word tells of them passing through the Stonetalon Mountains a few weeks ago.If you find their wagon, please, come find me immediately."
1438,"Find both Dalinda and Tyranis if you can and come back to me with your findings. Start your search at this fortress. I will contact my superiors in Darnassus immediately and let them know the situation.<name>, there is something else I wish to impress upon you. My superiors have shown some concern over Tyranis' and his motives for coming here. It is more important to them that Dalinda is found and brought back safely. Tyranis is to be... gauged before he is taken home."
1439,"We were brought here after the orcs slaughtered all our guards and servants. Oh, the terrible things they did to them! I thought surely they would kill us right there and then, but it became obvious they had other plans.Tyranis attempted to speak to them. I think he wanted to impress them with his knowledge of the arcane... I'm not sure why.Please, I can't leave here until I know what's happened to my brother. Find him, then come back for me when his fate is known."
1440,"So, the time is now then? I appreciate your efforts, and if the situation does not lend itself, then allow me to thank you now for everything you've done for me and my family. If you're ready, then there is nothing else for me here--we can leave when you feel the time is right."
1442,"Greetings, <name>. What can I do for one who follows a holy path?Ah, yes, Stilwell, the blacksmith... from long ago. I remember him well, though, I have not heard his name in some time.He never struck me as an impudent man, so I can only assume his desire for a Kor gem is noble.If you truly wish for one of the gems, then you must head to the northwest of Ashenvale. You will find Blackfathom Deeps there within some ancient ruins. The naga who still use the gems are down below. Do not go alone, <class>."
1444,"Jammal'an the Prophet sentenced me to exile from The Temple of Atal'Hakkar. I once felt the high priest was a worthy leader.His unyielding faith in his prophecy will bring about the destruction of the Atal'ai. If it hasn't already.When I expressed my concerns, I was labeled an infidel and ousted from the temple.Those artifacts you brought to me are harmless. But if Jammal'an has found the proper fetish enchantment for the summoning ritual, the world lies in great peril...."
1445,"So he spoke of Jammal'an's prophecy?The Atal'ai spiritual leader believes once Hakkar returns to Azeroth from the Nether, the god will grant the Atal'ai tribe immortality.Foolish trickery to bring about a premature doomsday if you ask me.But you say the exile spoke of enchanted fetishes? This concerns me greatly. If these are in fact the key to the Atal'ai ritual which caused this mess, we must understand their intrinsic powers.Venture into the Temple, and seize the fetishes!"
1446,"My Witherbark companions don't take kindly to strangers around their home.Me? I don't have a home anymore. I was exiled from my people, the great Atal'ai tribe of the Swamp of Sorrows.Our spiritual leader, Jammal'an, had what he called a prophecy. He believes the summoning of the god, Hakkar will bring the Atal'ai immortality.But I urged caution. What if the prophecy was nothing more than manipulation?I want revenge for my exile. Bring me Jammal'an's head. Maybe then my people will be free."
1447,"Yeah, you're obviously not the smartest <class> to come into Stormwind, but you're about to be one of the dumbest to never leave.Have you met me friends?"
1448,"There was a time when I was young and full of vigor like you, <class>.But now I'm old and unable to explore the world like I once did. Ah, the things I saw!But there was one mystery that eluded me. For my final quest, the Explorers' League sent me in search of The Temple of Atal'Hakkar. It was rumored to be located in the Swamp of Sorrows.Because of my frail state, I traveled the skies by gryphon in search of it but never found it.Help an old dwarf out? Perhaps you will have better luck on foot."
1449,"As I mentioned earlier, I attempted to scout the temple on my own from the air. Well, I wasn't exactly alone.I traveled to the renowned gryphon aviary at Aerie Peak in The Hinterlands. There I enlisted the aid of one of their finest pilots. The pilot fell off his mount, down into the swamp...In my old age the poor fellow's name eludes me. The master of the aviary would remember, no doubt.Journey there and seek out Falstad Wildhammer.We need to find out what happened to that pilot."
1450,"So you're a glorified errand < boy/girl> for some old Explorers' League geezer, eh?Well you listen to me, <class>. I don't know who your old buddy was flying around with down in Azeroth. Do I look like Gryphon Master Talonaxe to you? Do I?If you're so interested in the flight assignments why don't you ask the gryphon master? If I catch you idling around here for much longer, I'm going to put you to some real work.Now get a move on."
1451,"Rhapsody took quite a liking to the booze. Now don't get me wrong -- all of us dwarves up here at the aviary love a good ale when the time is right.But ol' Shindigger took to the liquor like a gryphon takes to the skies. And a damned shame it was, too. No one could fly like Rhapsody.First sign of trouble was when he came stumbling back from that mission with your buddy, Brohann. All went down hill quickly after that. Had to let him go.Last I heard, he's set up a brew camp to the east of here..."
1452,"Hiccup!So that crazy fool Brohann sent ya? My we had quite an adventure...Hiccup!If ya want me to tell ya what happened down in the swamp, I'm gonna need me something stiff to drink. It wasn't a pretty scene, ya see. Hiccup!Tell ya what... bring me what I need to whip up a Kalimdor Kocktail and I'll tell ya all about it.Gonna need some Roc gizzards from Tanaris... and let's see... some Groddoc and Ironfur livers from Feralas...A nice stiff Kalimdor Kocktail... that'll get me talking!"
1453,"There's work to be done in Desolace, <name>. It's an atrocious place, befouled by centaur and other nasties. But if you're looking for a good week's honest work, then head there, meet with Kreldig Ungor, and tell him I sentcha.You can find him holed up at Nijel's Point--it's a little cozy camp hidden in the mountains of northern Desolace. Just head east if you enter from the Stonetalon Mountains. It's easy to miss, so be on the lookout."
1454,"My first order of business is for the mage Karnitol--a noble of some sort in Stormwind. Seems his ship was attacked by sea giants while off the coast in the northwest of Desolace. He and his servants tried to bring one of his more valuable chests ashore, but when the sea giants attacked in droves, he chose to abandon it and teleport himself and his servants to safety.He wants us to find the chest and its contents, and return it to him in Stormwind."
1455,"You take a few moments to figure out what pried the chest open, and you notice along the sides and top of the chest, long, deep scratches that reveal that something other than a man or giant took interest in it. The marks don't appear as if they were caused by dagger or sword.After going through the chest you find it to be completely empty.Not having another course of action, you close the chest and prepare to leave. Kreldig will be disappointed."
1456,"Intriguing.Well, we might not be without hope quite yet.Along that same coast, but to the north near Ranazjar Isle, there're night elf ruins at the bottom of the ocean. A tribe of naga, the Slitherblade, make that their home. I think that'd be our best bet.If a scouting party went that far south, then they must've been pretty powerful. If you're gonna find Karnitol's belongings, I'd start with the more powerful naga: the tidehunters or sea witches."
1457,"Take Karnitol's things back to Roetten in Ironforge and he'll pay you for a job well done.Haha, if you're not careful, he's gonna be so pleased with ya that he'll ask you to join us full time.Again, great job, <name>.Be careful on your way back, and don't take too much time--Karnitol's not the most of patient of men, but he's very generous nonetheless."
1458,"One of my tasks out here involves picking up some reagents for Leftwitch, a gnome mage in Kharanos . Roetten seems to think it's easy coin in the bank since we're out here already. He doesn't really care that we're short-handed as is.The first few items on his list should be easy enough to get, and it'd be a good chunk of coin for anyone helping me out.I need some horns and claws from the Hatefury satyr to the east of here. Bring 'em back to me and we'll get started on the rest of the list."
1459,"Next on Leftwitch's list is... let's see... hmm. Oh, here it is.Simple enough, but pretty explicit in his directions. He needs venom from the scorpashi, and hide from some kodo. The fine print says both are from specific creatures: the venom's got to come from any of the scorpashi, and the hide's got to come from an aged kodo, not the dying or ancient ones.Mages, I tell ya, some of the stuff they want... it's just weird."
1465,"As you continue your search of the wagon you find not only a pendant, but also footprints leading off towards the south. In the distance you can see smoke rising from a large fort. The smoke is from a kept fire, not the burning of buildings, and your instincts tell you that the Malems, if still alive, were taken that direction.You think Vahlarriel at Nijel's Point should not only see the pendant you've found, but also know about the signs of life to the south."
1466,"This is the last of the items, and I won't lie, it ain't pretty. I'm also expecting this to take you a little bit longer than the other items.So, enough with the warning, let's get this started. Leftwitch says he needs: ten brains from either mana eaters, mage hunters, or ley hunters. Ten nether wings from a nether maiden, sister or sorceress. And... ten vials of doomwarder blood from a doomwarder captain, or lord.Simple enough, huh? Sheesh... if you wanna pass on this one, I'd understand."
1467,"To get paid, you're gonna have to get back to Ironforge and speak to Roetten himself. He'll love getting Leftwitch's package out of the way anyway. Just give him this and it should be enough to get your booty.And don't worry, I'm still going to put in a good word for you when I get back. I shouldn't be in Desolace much longer."
1468,"You're willing to help us here at the orphanage?  Bless you, friend; your aid during Children's Week will be invaluable."
1469,"Before the flight, I drank me a whole keg of stout. Hiccup!And what a flight it was. Zipping around with Brohann following me. Didn't see no temple though. Hiccup!Well, didn't see no temple till I got a little too tipsy and fell off my mount. I plunged right into the water and was sucked down. Found myself surrounded by a bunch of creepy trolls. Sure swam out of there fast! Even made off with this troll souvenir. Here, take it to Brohann and let him know his temple is down there, indeed. Hiccup!"
1470,"Greetings, child. I can see that you are still young in the ways of the warlock, power still eluding your grasp. I can sense your eagerness to learn.And you will learn.There is no strength in ignorance. Knowledge is our greatest power. Through its application, we can control the chaotic magics and beings of the void, bending them to our will.I will show you how to bind a servant to your will, but first you must bring me three skulls of the rattlecage skeletons near the abandoned smithy."
1471,"Surely you have seen the circle of summoning below us? Only there will you be able to draw forth an unbound voidwalker.Using these runes, you will be able to draw it forth, and then you must dominate it through strength of arms and magic.When it is subdued, it will be indentured to you. Come to me then, and I will elucidate the spell of summoning, so that it may serve you to whatever end you wish."
1472,"A succubus is a devourer of souls, destroyer of hearts, tempter of men. A creature of profound evil and of singular mind.It cannot be brought into our world without a stimulus.Thus we use its own strength against it. With the hearts of good men, pure men, loving men, the succubus will be unable to resist, and will cross into our world. Then you can dominate it, and make it your own.Speak with my assistant, Godrick Farsan, within the Temple. He will help you find your bait."
1473,"It seems the consensus that you are ready to learn to summon a voidwalker.A being created of the chaos that lies beyond, if you summon one but cannot control it, you will be torn asunder.The first voidwalker was summoned by Egalin, and in his grimoire is the process explained.Unfortunately, it was stolen from us by an agent of the Scarlet Crusade who has it secreted away in his base at a tower to the west. Bring it to me, and I will impart the knowledge to you."
1474,"Using these hearts, cast a spell at the summoning circle to open a doorway for the succubus to come through. Your powers are greater now, and you will need all of them to defeat the succubus.Beware its charms, <name>, many a strong mind has been bound to its will. When overcome, the succubus will be returned to the void, and I will teach you the spell to summon it forth at your command."
1475,"According to legend, The Temple of Atal'Hakkar is a holy shrine dedicated to the ancient god, Hakkar the Soulflayer. Maintained by a vicious tribe of trolls named the Atal'ai, the temple is rumored to be impenetrable.Now sunk beneath the Pool of Tears, retrieving artifacts from the temple is even more difficult. But that's what I need you to do, <name>.Aid me by gathering the intact Atal'ai Tablets. Bring them to me and I will return to the Explorers' Guild a hero. Together we will share the glory."
1476,"Men of honor and goodness? Does such a man exist?It took much research, but through bits of overheard stories, I managed to find two men that should do.The first is Dalin Forgewright, who has dedicated himself to the care of the Lordaeron refugees, whom are refused by their kin at the Greymane Wall.The other is Comar Villard, a man who remains faithful to his lost love, wandering the Wetlands for a sign of his wife.Deliver their hearts to Carendin. But first, let me show you your quarry."
1477,"Our mages are conducting research at Nethergarde Keep in the Blasted Lands, research vital to our understanding of the Dark Portals. They require nearly constant supplies, but our supply line to Nethergarde is tenuous.You must help ensure the supplies make it to Nethergard.  Report to Watchmaster Sorigal in Darkshire, and do as he asks.  This task will take you into hostile lands, <name>.  Prepare yourself."
1478,"Ah, <name>! I just received word from Carendin Halgar that he would like to see you for further training.You should be proud of yourself, <name>. It's not every day that Master Halgar personally sees fit to instruct a young warlock.You'll be able to find him in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity, near the Temple of the Damned."
1479,"I've heard stories about how the night elves have their bank in a tree - one that looks like a bear!  That's so cool!  Night elves are neat how they like nature and stuff, but bears are just totally awesome!Would you take me to see the bear-tree in Darnassus, please?  There's a boat that will take us close to there, and it shouldn't take very long.  Please, please, please!"
1480,"The torn skin smells rotten, and is remarkably pliable for something that appears to be dry and fragile.As you unroll it, you can clearly see the red markings of some kind of language on one side. At the bottom of the skin is a very clear symbol that you guess is a signature of some kind.Perhaps it is something Maurin could tell you more about?"
1481,"I believe I can find this demon lord given the proper reagents.If he is indeed as powerful as I suspect, I will need items gathered from deadly creatures. But you act in the Warchief's name, so I am sure you will accept my task.First, I will have to break any wards he has against scrying. For this, I will need the scalp from a satyr--but not any satyr. The scalp must come from a Hatefury shadowstalker.Search for them among the ancient ruins in the northeast of Desolace."
1482,"An oracle crystal would do nicely. They are crafted by the naga for their oracles to use.Northwest of here, along the coast, is a vast coral reef that the naga have taken as their home when this close to the shore. You can find their oracles there. The Slitherblade are deadly and will not react kindly to your intrusions, so be careful and make haste.When you return, we shall see about finding this demon lord Azrethoc."
1483,"The Venture Company stole many of the best goblin minds, but from time to time, we get the opportunity to steal some back.A while ago, the Venture Company outfit in the Stonetalon Mountains hired Gerenzo Wrenchwhistle--a gnome! Their other engineer, Ziz Fizziks, was so taken aback by this, he pleaded with me to find him new employment with the Tinkers' Union. I set him on a few tasks, but he might need help.Maybe you could look in on him for me? He's stationed at the western edge of Windshear Crag."
1484,"This creature is far more dangerous than I had anticipated.  No doubt Takata questions my abilities to take on such a creature, and it would insult his honor if he were not informed about what just happened.Speak to the swordsman, tell him you are willing to slay the demon if he would allow it, but do not press too hard. It is better if he thinks it his own idea."
1485,"Those warlocks who came before us have earned the distrust of the Horde, and while we are tolerated, we are not loved.This has not brought the warlocks closer together, however, as many choose to live reclusively, dabbling in their magics alone. I will not seek to lead you down one path or the other, but only help you in your maturation.Before I teach you the art of summoning, bring me six heads of the vile familiars from the cave to the northeast."
1486,"As Naralex descended deeper into his nightmare, a strange breed of beasts arose from beneath the Barrens into the Wailing Caverns.These deviate creatures have strange, otherworldly properties. While evil in nature, it is my opinion that some good can come from their existence here in Kalimdor. I believe their hides will be of particular use in the ways of leatherworking.If you feel up to the task, venture into the caves below and retrieve some deviate hides."
1487,"Naralex had a noble goal.Our great leader aspired to enter the Emerald Dream and help regrow these harsh lands back into the lush forest it once was. But something went terribly wrong.Naralex's dream turned into a nightmare and corrupt creatures began to inhabit the caverns.While some Disciples of Naralex seek to awake our master, my concern is with ridding these caves of the evil beasts.Brave the caverns, <name>, and eradicate the deviate spawn."
1488,"Although I have no knowledge of this Lord Azrethoc, I agree with Maurin, he must be stopped; especially if he is attempting to gain influence over the Burning Blade to further his goals.You have already shown you wish to aid the Warchief, and I would trust you to gather a party to slay the demon lord and his warlock servant.When you are ready, head directly south,  and return to me when the threat has been ended."
1489,"The shells you brought me have a taint, one I have never before seen.  I am certain the water of the Oases is the cause, and I can sense the confusion they cause this land.  It is as if the land dreams and cannot awake.The Wailing Caverns must be the source of the taint.  But before you go there, speak with Hamuul Runetotem, the elder druid.  I sent word to him of the happenings in the Barrens.  He is wise, and can offer you counsel.You will find him in Thunder Bluff, on the Elder Rise."
1490,"I entered the land of dreams, and dreamed of a cult of druids who dwell in the Wailing Caverns.  I saw that their goals were once noble, but they have lost their way.  They are now servants of the taint seeping through the Barrens.I am old and my strength fails.  I could not long dwell in that dreaming place and know little more of the tainted druids.  But Nara is young and her spirit is fierce.  She remained in the dreaming when I fled.Speak with Nara.  She is in the tent, over yonder."
1491,"Ok, so the raptor horns didn't work so well.  But that's all right -- no one got rich on their first try!  And besides, I think I found something that'll work even better in my smart drinks!There is a substance called Wailing Essence, and I think it is the cause of the strange plants and animals in the Barrens.  Get me some and I'll try it in my drink!I heard the essence gathers in ectoplasmic creatures in the Wailing Caverns to the west.  Hunt those creatures and gather the essence."
1492,"I have need to send a crate of potions, reagents and other items to my associates in the Old World. Little time I have to actually see them to the dock at Ratchet, and the last caravan has already left.If you could, please take this to Wharfmaster Dizzywig. He will ensure that it is placed on the next boat to Blackwater Cove."
1498,"As a warrior, one of our most crucial tasks is... protection.  We are the shield of the Horde, and we keep our weaker brethren safe.  If you are to join in our ranks, then you must prove your mettle to me.Go to Thunder Ridge in Durotar, where live the lightning hides and thunder lizards.  Hunt the beasts!  Show me you are tougher than they!  Brave their assaults and bring me a stack of their singed scales as proof.Do this, and then I will teach you."
1499,"Zureetha has been sending novices like yourself to help cull the numbers of the creatures in the cave near where you fought the vile familiars.I think it would be good for you to gain experience by assisting her. Be sure to tell her that you assisted with the imp problem, she'll probably have a reward for you."
1501,"So few warlocks remain... We risk much, but the risks are warranted. You must quickly reach maturity in your ability if you are to be of use to the Horde and to the Warchief.It is time that you learned a new summoning spell.First, you must recover the Tablet of Verga, which was stolen by warlocks of the Burning Blade and is now kept at their lair in Skull Rock to the east of the city. With the tablet, I will show you the runes necessary to summoning a voidwalker."
1502,"It is vital that a warrior's weapon is one of quality.  And if there is an orc who can craft quality weapons, then that orc is Thun'grim Firegaze.  He is a hermit who dwells atop the hills east of the Crossroads.If you seek a weapon, warrior, then you should seek Thun'grim.  To find him, first travel to the Crossroads to the west, then strike east into the hills.  His camp is high on a hilltop."
1503,"I will give you a weapon, <name>, but first you must aid me.  The Razormanes to the northwest came into my camp a few nights past.  They would not meet me in combat, but they know my eyes are bad--a few distracted me with snorts while others stole from me!  The cowards!They took an iron chest, and within it were some forged steel bars.  If you can recover them then I will give you the weapon you seek.Search for the iron box within the quilboar camps, and return with the forged steel bars."
1504,"Now, observe the Tablet of Verga, for it contains the glyphs you will need for the summoning. Take them to the circle in Neeru Fireblade's tent on the other side of the cavern. There you will be able to call for the voidwalker.You must defeat it using whatever physical and magical means you have at your disposal. When this is completed, return to me with the glyphs of summoning and I will demonstrate how you may bind the creature to your will."
1505,The Horde honors its warriors because their strength is unquestioned.  But the truly great warriors are great students as well.
1506,"You there. <name>, right?I hope your schedule isn't busy, because Gan'rul wants to see you right away. You'll find him with the senior warlocks in the Cleft of Shadow.Based on my past dealings with Gan'rul, your summons is either a very good thing or a very bad thing."
1507,"The time has come for you to learn more of the summoning magics. You will learn to summon a succubus, a creature of incredible mental powers. It can lull those of weak minds into its servitude--but have no fear! I feel certain that you will be equal to the challenge.A succubus can only be summoned when baited with an item that represents great devotion and love. I leave it to you to find such an object.A suggestion? Speak with Cazul... There seems to be little the ancient warlock does not know."
1508,"Hmm... But, of course, that is not why you have come to speak with me.If Gan'rul has sent you to me, it must be that you are to summon a succubus, and need an object to use for enticement.Hmm... If you trust a blind man to lead you, <name>, then listen. In the bluffs of Orgrimmar, west of the wind rider tower, lives Zankaja. She waits for the return of her mate.Go to her."
1509,"My mate, Dogran, was recently sent to the Crossroads for duty. It was a promotion, and he was very proud.I was sad, of course, but I didn't let him know that. And worried, too. The Barrens is a more dangerous place than Orgrimmar, and I feared the worst.Now it's been a week after he should have returned, and I have received no word from him...Perhaps you could go to the Crossroads and see if they have any news? He worked with Gazrog, who should still be stationed there."
1510,"He was stationed at Camp Taurajo, where we've been trying to weed out the quilboar. He led a few grunts to one of their camps, where he was hurt bad. The others made it back and tried to rescue him. He was in bad shape, his wounds festered, so they were afraid to move him without patching him up first.They sent a message here, requesting a healing draught from the trolls at the Malaka'jin at the base of the Stonetalon Mountains. We sent someone to get it, but they haven't returned yet."
1511,"I figured there might be another coming to get the draught, so I prepared it anyways.Here you go, <name>. Mind you, you should only give half of it to him! That will give him enough strength to move without bleeding himself dry. Wait a night, then give him the other half.Anyways, you'll want to bring this to Logmar at Camp Taurajo. From what the first one told me, he should have an idea where this Dogran is."
1512,"Zankaja is young and beautiful. To be chained to an invalid... I will not allow her to suffer that injustice.Leave me, <name>. And thank you. I may end my life in glorious battle, instead of a lifeless husk.And please, I would ask you not to tell my mate of this... I do not want guilt on her conscience."
1513,"Take this to the summoning circle in Neeru's tent, <name>. Summon forth a foul succubus, then show it your mastery. I believe in the strength of your magic. As always, though, be wary, for pride and overconfidence has overcome many a promising warlock.When you have defeated it, return the pendant to me so that I might deliver the news to Zankaja."
1515,"You've made it this far, so if you want to see this through to the end, I won't stop you. I can't spare you any additional manpower though, you'll be on your own.Dogran is being held in a quilboar camp to the north of here. Look for a group of two huts. He'll be heavily guarded--that is, if they haven't killed him yet, or he hasn't succumbed to his wounds.Good luck."
1516,"The time is now, young <class>. You've grown strong and your spirit endures like the earth. Following the shaman's path shows you have wisdom before even proving yourself.The element of earth will guide your destiny, becoming part of you if you are ready. But you must stand before the earth itself. If you are ready, then you will see things only shaman know of.Seek out the Felstalkers to the north, and take from them two of their hooves. Return to me then, and we shall speak more of your future."
1517,"A sapta is a drink created to bind our spirits to the elements. Fused with magic, the potion will allow the strong willed to see the elements as no one else can. Your spirit will be connected to the element the sapta was created for, and only a select few shaman know the recipe.The sapta is always drunk in a holy place, and never anywhere else--remember that.Seek out Spirit Rock southwest of here--it is found at the end of the Hidden Path. Drink your sapta there, and... well, you shall see."
1518,"Take this rough quartz from me and bring it to Canaga Earthcaller as proof of our meeting. He will craft a totem for you, and this pebble will be the heart of it. As small as it may seem, you will come to find that size does not matter, and that even the smallest of things can outlast many others.Be patient, <name>. Remain strong. And seek wisdom. This is what earth asks of you. In the end, you shall become one with the earth--respect it as it shall respect you."
1519,"The time has come, young <class>. Your body ages and grows strong, and your spirit endures like the earth. I see it within you-you have wisdom already.The earth guides our people, and it speaks to us, as it will to you in time. But you must be tested. If you are ready, then you shall see things only our kind know of.Seek out the Bristleback shamans in their ravine to the east, and take from them a salve they use in their rituals. Return to me only when you have enough for your own potion."
1520,"A sapta is a drink created to bind our spirits to the elements. Fused with magic, the potion will allow the open minded to see the elements as no one has seen them before. Your spirit will forever be tied to the element the sapta was created for, and only a select few of our kind know the secrets of its creation.The sapta is always imbibed in a holy place, and never anywhere else.Seek out the shaman shrine to the east of here and drink of the sapta."
1521,"Take this rough quartz from me and bring it to Seer Ravenfeather as proof of our meeting. She will craft a totem for you, and this pebble will be the heart of it. As small as it may seem, you will come to find that size does not matter, and that even the smallest of things can outlast mountains.Be patient, <name>. Remain strong. And seek wisdom. This is what earth asks of you. In the end, you shall become one with the earth--respect it as it shall respect you."
1522,"Fire be witcha, mon. I see you be strong in da ways of earth already, an' me tinkin' you be ready to talk to Kranal.Kranal live north of da Crossroads in da Barrens. He be strong in da ways of da elements and can teach ya da ways of fire... if you tink you be ready.He be easy ta find, just don' go too far--ya go too far an' ya find yerself in da elves' lands."
1523,"Long has it been since you were last tested, <name>. You have shown patience thus far in your studies, but the time has come for you to learn more. The time has come for you to learn about destruction... and chaos. The element of fire is yours for the understanding, if you're prepared to pay for it.Seek out Kranal Fiss in the Barrens. He lives in a small dwelling north of the Crossroads, but be mindful, if you've reached the night elf lands, you've gone too far."
1524,"You are powerful enough to wield the totem of fire, but that does not mean you are ready.Along the Southfury River in Durotar, before the Great Sea, lies a hidden trail to one of the highest peaks in the land. Find your way to the top and you shall find one of our holy shrines watched over by Telf Joolam--the Shrine of the Dormant Flame.Take this torch to him--it marks that you attempt to tame fire. Return it to me aflame by the brazier at the shrine and I will see you are given the totem of fire."
1525,"But you did not come here for a history lesson, did you? You came for the Eternal Flame and fire totem.The first step is to create a sapta and bind you to the flame.I can create the fire sapta for you if you bring me two items. The first is fire tar, a simple item usually carried by Razormane spellcasters in eastern Barrens.The second item will be more dangerous: a reagent pouch from one of the cultists of the Burning Blade. You can find them in a cave above the ravines northeast of Razor Hill."
1526,"The fire sapta is finished. The time has come for you to face the flame. Use the sapta at the shrine and head to the top of the mountain to face the manifestation there. He will not attack until you are ready, but he will realize you are able to see him.Strike him down swiftly, <name>, for he shall only grow in power the longer you take to slay him. Once he is defeated, place his glowing embers within the brazier and light the torch."
1527,"Torch firmly in hand, you turn away from the brazier and look out over Durotar. You feel an excitement tugging at your spirit as the wind picks up and forces the flame to dance violently.You start off down the path back to the Barrens in search of Kranal Fiss."
1528,"Water be in ya future, mon. I see you be strong in da ways of fire already, an' me tinkin' you be ready to talk to Islen.Islen live along the coast of da Barrens. If ya head south along the Southfury River, ya canna miss her--look fer da big shark! She be strong in da ways of da elements and can teach ya da ways of water... if you tink you be ready.She be easy ta find, just don' go too far south--she be jus' beyond Ratchet."
1529,"Long has it been since you were last tested, <name>. You have shown patience thus far in your studies, but the time has come for you to learn more. The time has come for you to learn about the purity of water.Seek out Islen Waterseer in the Barrens. She is along the eastern coast, south of the Southfury River and Ratchet. You will find her there at her fishing hut. Good luck to you, <name>."
1530,"If there is one lesson you must learn of water, it is this: water means rebirth.Its power flows, erodes, and makes clean all manner of things. You will find its ability to heal and replenish incomparable, but only when it is pure.When you understand that water, when polluted, can devastate all that it touches, you will appreciate how vital a resource it is.If you wish the water sapta, find Brine deep in Southern Barrens. Her home is continually molested by the quilboar there."
1531,"You be makin' headway now, mon. Your be ready to prove yerself worthy of the air totem, but first, ya must fin' Prate Cloudseer in Thousand Needles. She be willin' ta tell ya how to get yer air totem if ya treat her wit enough respect.Head south through the Barrens, and after ya reach Thousand Needles, head east. You'll find her hiddin' in a hole wit' her boyfriend--haha, don' tell her I be dissin' her none--she not take it too kindly."
1532,"The winds of Kalimdor rush to meet you and you shall be counted among some of our most powerful < brothers/sisters>. I am proud to see you have come this far and have such a promising future.The element of air is a difficult one to control, but I have faith that your skills will overcome any obstacles that are placed in front of you.Head to the very south of the Barrens, and enter Thousand Needles. It is there, far to the east, that you will find Prate Cloudseer. She will teach you more."
1534,"Take this waterskin and head deep into the lush forest the night elves call Ashenvale. It is to the far north of the Barrens.Once you've entered the forest, travel west. Along the mountains that separate Stonetalon and Ashenvale, and beyond Lake Mystral, you will find a holy place: the Ruins of Stardust. At the center of the lake you will find a small fountain.Bring me a sample of the fountain's water. It will be the final component you'll need before I send you back to Islen."
1535,"To find understanding and gain the sapta from me, you must seek out only the purest forms of water. As you fetch the samples for me, take note of your surroundings. Be aware of the creatures that rely on the water, that protect it. See how it affects forests and deserts. Witness how the very substance that sustains life will force creatures to take lives.We shall start with a simple task: down below my hut there is a pond of the precious liquid. Fill this skin with it and return to me."
1536,Long ago I followed some companions into the Hillsbrad Foothills. We defended ourselves from some tenacious humans who make their home there and we found ourselves in a small town the Forsaken had taken over: Tarren Mill.It was there I found a most peculiar thing: in the center of town was a small well of fresh spring water. I'm not sure the plagued citizens of the town even realize its value--it's a small holy vestige in an unhallowed sea.Bring me a sample of that water in this waterskin.
1558,"Ironforge is where all the dwarves and gnomes live.  Near there is a place called Loch Modan, and the dwarves built a HUGE dam there.  They say it's one of the biggest things anyone's ever made.  Wow!Could you take me to Loch Modan and see the dam there, please?  I think it is the Stone... um... Stonewrench Dam?  Stonewrought?  It's big - that's for sure.  I'd like to look out over the big waterfall.  I promise I won't lean over too far!"
1560,"I am so lost!My wife, Torta, sent me out to fetch dinner and I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere.Would you be so kind as to lead me back to Torta? She's waiting for me just south of Steamwheedle Port."
1578,"The mountaineers of Loch Modan are fighting troggs, and having a busy time of it!  They need constant supplies of new armor and weapons if we're ever to get a handle on those troggs.That's why my colleague Thorvald is there, trying to keep the mountaineers in good gear.  So if you were to make some copper axes and copper chain belts and bring them to Thorvald, he would be obliged.  He might even share his knowledge with you.Thorvald is in Loch Modan's southern guard tower."
1579,"I came to Auberdine because of the quiet.  I want to invent my inventions where it's quiet, because after a night of drinking I don't like all the noise of Ironforge!So I took a ship to Auberdine and had a little too much to drink on the way.  I dropped my box of gaffer jacks overboard!  I need my gaffer jacks!I don't know exactly where I dropped them, but if you fish for them in the ocean you might get lucky..."
1580,"We know you're lucky, but... just how lucky are you, <name>?One night I was wandering the roads of Darkshore.  I was looking for a good river or lake to try my new self-propelled, exploding duck decoy and I think I was a little tipsy... because I passed out and awoke hours later in Auberdine.  My hair was singed and my bag of electropellers was gone!  I must have dropped them in the water!I need those electropellers!  Maybe you can fish them out of some lake or stream in Darkshore..."
1581,"Our herb and alchemy shop is booming, but my husband spends so much time mixing potions that we never have time for each other.Can you help us?If you can bring me a supply of pre-made elixirs, then I would be happy to trade with you.  I have some rare herbs that you might find useful."
1582,"We in Darnassus, especially we craftsman, are quite busy.  Young adventurers are eager to test themselves in the wilderness, and are in constant need of supplies.If you can help me fill my orders of leather goods, then perhaps I can teach you an advanced leatherworking technique."
1598,"You there! <name>, right?I hope you're sure about becoming a warlock, because if you can't hold your own, you're likely to get pulled under.I'm to teach you, but I need to make sure you're strong enough first.There was a novice studying at the Abbey who ran off to join the Defias Brotherhood. Why do I care? Well, he stole some important books.One of those happens to be a book I've wanted for myself, the Powers of the Void. Steal it for me, they have it hidden at their tent in the Vineyards."
1599,"You must be the new warlock everyone's been whispering about. Must be someone's taken a liking to you if they've asked me to take time away from my research to start your training.Don't worry, I won't hold it against you.The simplest of the summoning spells you will learn is that of the imp. Before I impart this to you, however, you must prove that you have the necessary magical and physical ability.Bring me three feather charms from the frostmane novices from the cave to the southwest."
1618,"We dwarves aren't the only ones fighting.  Our human allies have their hands full too!Redridge is under periodic attack from blackrock orcs, and their supply of equipment is always low.  If you were to help them out, I'm sure their resident blacksmith, Verner Osgood, would teach you a trick or two."
1638,"You've shown yourself to be a competent warrior, <name>.  But you're still young and have a lot to learn.Speak with Harry Burlguard--he's usually in the Pig and Whistle tavern, in the Old Town of Stormwind.  Harry is an old veteran and a good teacher.  He can show you a few moves that'll keep you breathing longer."
1639,"Yeah, I can teach you.  But first I wanna see what moves you have already.See that drunk over there at the end of the bar?  Bartleby?  I want you to get his mug.Hah, and if you know Bartleby then you know he won't just give it to you."
1640,"You want what??  You're crazy!The only way you'll get this mug is if you pry it from my cold, dead fingers..."
1642,"In all things, a paladin must reflect the Light which supplements our strength. To strive to be divine for one of our kind does not mean we strive for godhood--we strive to be good in all actions.Although called upon to smite evil in these harsh times, you must always remember that it's aiding others that will truly set you apart from the citizens of Azeroth. Compassion, patience, bravery--these things mean as much to a paladin as strength in battle.Know this well, and never forget it."
1643,"Your task then, <name>, is to find someone here in Stormwind that is in need of aid. Someone who is pure of heart and motive. Perhaps someone helping others. Perhaps someone in need of a guide. Regardless, the person must have noble intent and be relying on your kindness.Do this, and return to me when you are finished. Then, we shall discuss more of your path and what it means to be a paladin of the Light."
1644,"Bless their hearts, most of them have no families because of the Scourge attacks in the last decade.My husband John collects the materials for me to make the shirts and pants for the children, but I haven't even had time to do that. I've been too focused on keeping food on their plates, and a roof over their heads.What's that? You'd be willing to help? Oh, thank the Light, and thank you, <name>.If you could bring me some linen cloth so I can sew clothes for the kids, that would help me out so much."
1646,"In all things, a paladin must reflect the Light which supplements our strength. To strive to be divine for one of our kind does not mean we strive for godhood--we strive to be good in all actions.Although called upon to smite evil in these harsh times, you must always remember that it's aiding others that will truly set you apart from the citizens of Azeroth. Compassion, patience, bravery--these things mean as much to a paladin as strength in battle.Know this well, and never forget it."
1647,"Your task then, <name>, is to find someone here in Ironforge that is in need of aid. Someone who is pure of heart and motive. Perhaps someone helping others. Perhaps someone in need of a guide. Regardless, the person must have noble intent and be relying on your kindness.Do this, and return to me when you are finished. Then, we shall discuss more of your path and what it means to be a paladin of the Light. I will remain here in the temple for your return. Other paladins will need my guidance also."
1648,"My wife and I run an orphanage in Stormwind, mostly for children who have lost parents due to the attacks by the Scourge in the last decade. I come to Ironforge every month or so to see about collecting more supplies from the citizens here, and talk to the various groups to see if they can do anything to help.This trip's been agonizingly slow, and not very productive.If I could just get some more linen for my wife to make some clothes, I could finally send a shipment home."
1649,"Valor, and all the virtues that go along with it, are like rare minerals: you must cherish them when you find them because of their value, but you must also take time to harvest them... refine them. When mixed together properly, a strong alloy is formed, sometimes unbreakable by even the most powerful blows.This strength, your faith, your bravery, must be tested. You must learn to never lose faith and realize that with the power of the Light, you can overcome things that most others cannot."
1650,"Good! Your lack of hesitation is a sure sign that you are prepared and eager to test yourself. So be it.At the very ends of Westfall's Longshore, a small house overlooks the ocean. There, a couple lives, the Stilwells. Jordan is an incredible smith, and he's gone to Ironforge to meet with the dwarves for a while. But this has left Daphne, his wife, alone and unprotected.Reports suggest that the Defias have all but taken over the area, Daphne may need some protection from the villains. Go there."
1651,"Now, they'll be coming again soon, I'd wager, so get yourself ready.I've got myself a gun in the house. I'll grab it and be ready to help you out, but for the most part, you're on your own.I've no idea how many they'll send, but I'm sure it'll be more than the few they sent earlier.Ask the Light for whatever blessings you can because... did you hear that? I think they're coming.We make our stand near the house!"
1652,"Please, return to Duthorian and let him know that I'm safe for now. I have you and the Church to thank for that.He'll send word to Ironforge to let my Jordan know that he has nothing to fear.Oh, how I miss my husband. I can't wait till he returns."
1653,"Actually, I have no doubt that Jordan himself would like to thank you, and seeing as I need a messenger to send word that his wife is safe, I think you'd be a perfect choice.Jordan was to be a paladin of the Light before his dedication to his father's craft took him on another path--he's intimately familiar with our way of life and is considered among our most faithful.He should still be in Ironforge--he likes to work outside the gates during the day, something about the cool mountain air."
1654,"I'd like to reward you if you'd be willing to accept such a thing? Don't misunderstand me, my generosity is dependent on how much help you can be, but I see us both benefiting greatly from such an alliance.I will craft for you a weapon worthy of what you've accomplished, a symbol of paladinhood and the Light, but you must gather the items I need to craft it. I've already started taking notes on the items, it just requires someone brave and skilled enough to recover them. What do you say, <class>?"
1655,"Ach, ya startled me, < man/woman>! Can't ya see I was lost in thought?What's that? Jordan's shipment... fer Ironforge. Ahhh, yeah, I know whatcha speak of. Mo'grosh ogres... dat's who took me ol' friend's ore shipment. Caravan was headin' here from the Wetlands and was ambushed. The guard who survived their attack just passed away a few days ago--healer couldn't get to 'em fast enough.If you want the shipment, you'll have to head northeast across the Loch. It's got to be there somewhere."
1656,"<name>, please, I beg of you, can you help me? I have not finished my tasks here on the Mesa--I'm in the middle of my Rite of Strength--and my father asked me to deliver these furs to the inn in Bloodhoof.I'm far from rested enough to complete both my rite and this task for my father. Would you mind going on for me?The inn is pleasant and a perfect place to rest during your long travels. I'm sure you'll agree once you see it."
1657,"Celebrate Hallow's End in style... by bringing grief to our enemies in Southshore!Take one of these specially crafted stink bombs.  It is filled with an odiferous funk that no human - or any weak-willed beast for that matter - can stand to smell.  You'll need to throw it right in the heart of Southshore for it to do its job, so be prepared for a fight against the Alliance!When you've completed this task... this tribute to our liberation, return to me!"
1658,"I need brave individuals to head up to Tirisfal Glade and check out the Wickerman Festival.  I'm not going to lie - heading up there will be dangerous.  The guards at the festival will be exceptionally vicious.  Still, we need to know how big the festival is this year, and how much trouble the Forsaken are going to cause us during Hallow's End.If you're up for it, head to Tirisfal and scout out the festival.  Return to me with the information, and I'll make sure you're well compensated."
1661,"I greet you once again, <name>. I am more proud to call you < brother/sister> than ever before--your dedication is a tribute to us all.The time has come for me to bestow a great gift upon you. But know this, for now I give you this freely, but later, when time permits, this will be a much greater challenge to all paladins who choose to undertake my quest.Speak to me again and I shall grant you a great boon."
1665,"Ok, here's my mug.  Wait!  Let me finish what's in it first... there we go."
1666,"You've learned a few moves, but you could still use a decent weapon.  I bet if you spoke with Marshal Haggard he could help you.Marshal Haggard lives in a manor in Elwynn Forest, at the Eastvale Lumber Camp.  He's retired now but he collected a lot of gear during his career.Let him know I sent you, and with luck he'll have a spare weapon to offer."
1667,"Burlguard sent you, did he?  Yes, I have spare weapons around here, but first I have a task for you...A while ago a Defias villain Dead-tooth Jack tricked me.  It was dark and he was wearing a Stormwind tabard and I thought he was Marshal Dughan.  He said he needed my old Stormwind Marshal's badge and I gave it to him... and then he laughed and ran off before I could catch him!Get back my badge!  Dead-tooth Jack probably has it stowed in his camp to the south."
1678,"If you want to rise in the ranks of the warriors, then you better be tough.  I can teach you new moves but before that, prove to me you can handle yourself against real foes.Vejrek is the toughest troll you'll find in these parts, and he's who you have to beat.  He has a hut in the foothills just south of Frostmane HoldBring me Vejrek's head and I'll know you have mettle."
1679,"Hello, warrior!  You show a lot of promise, but you still need to learn some tricks and Muren Stormpike is just the dwarf to teach you.You can find Muren at the Hall of Arms in the Military Ward of Ironforge.  Talk to him when you're ready to learn what it is to be a warrior."
1680,"Now that you've learned some moves, it's time to get you a decent weapon.  Speak with Tormus Deepforge.  He can make you a weapon I'm sure you'll like.You'll find Tormus here in Ironforge, at the Great Forge."
1681,"My mentor, Sturgy Ironband, had a compound south of Helm's Bed Lake in eastern Dun Morogh.  There he taught blacksmithing and he was the best.But one day, one of his students brought him a load of strange ore.  Master Ironband called it umbral ore and was eager to work with it, but soon after it arrived... a band of Dark Iron dwarves attacked his compound.  They killed everyone!Enter Ironband's compound, <name>, and avenge my master's death.  And bring me the load of umbral ore that caused it."
1683,"Before I can teach you, you must show me your resolve.The satyr Vorlus Vilehoof has found one of our remote moonwells, southeast of the Ban'ethil Barrow Den.  He now splashes within it, defiling its pure waters with his filth.Find Vorlus at the moonwell and destroy him.  Bring me his horn as proof and I will begin your advanced training as a warrior.The path to the moonwell is hidden well, <name>, but stay focused and alert and you will find it."
1684,"Greetings, warrior.  Your skill grows, but there is more to your profession than you may believe.  To further progress, you must soon find a teacher.The warrior Elanaria dwells in Darnassus, at the Warrior's Terrace.  She can instruct you."
1685,"Isn't that how it always works? Was looking for you all day and couldn't find you, now when I'm not expecting it, you come and walk right up to me.I've wasted enough time trying to find you, so I won't delay you any longer. Master Gakin's summoned you for additional training. Seems to me you should seek him out as soon as possible.You'll find him in the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb tavern. By the way, you might want to keep that particular location quiet. Don't want word spreading about it."
1686,"You have learned much, <name>.  Now we will craft you a weapon.  A warrior's weapon.To do this, you must travel to Darkshore.Long ago a ship crashed upon the rocks near the Auberdine lighthouse, scattering many crates of elunite ore along the ocean floor.First, you must defeat the elunite's guardian, the Shade of Elura.  Once the ship's captain, she cursed herself to roam the deeps and protect her shipment for all time.  Defeat her, gain her medallion, and gather the crates of lost Elunite."
1687,"Sometimes late at night, our matrons at the orphanage will tell us spooky stories.  Those RULE!  There's one about a ghost that haunts a lighthouse in Westfall.  They say he was a pirate captain who had his ship taken from him by other pirates.  Wow!Could you please take me to the lighthouse in Westfall?  I wanna see if the ghost of that captain is there!  I promise to stay close to you; I won't run off or anything!"
1688,"I had a student named Surena Caledon. She stood where you stand now, eager to learn of warlock magic, and possessing no small bit of talent. More than that she was young and pleasing to the eye. Had I seen it then, the traitorous trollop!The thieving wench ran off with one of the Defias, Erlan Drudgemoor. While her loss is of little importance, I gifted her a bloodstone choker that I must have.Her life means nothing to me now. You will find her at the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch. Retrieve what is mine."
1689,"By retrieving my choker and besting Surena, you've proven that you're at least as capable as she was.With that said, I can tell you're direly in need of training. You can manage the flows of magic, yes, but being a warlock is much more than that.I will show you how to command a voidwalker, but before I can, you must call one forth at a summoning circle and subdue it using whatever weapons--physical and magical--you have at your disposal. Use the magic of this choker at the summoning circle below."
1690,"You there!  It's time for you to be a big helper to the Gadgetzan Water Company.The Wastewander nomads out in the Tanaris desert have seized almost all the water wells!  Without access to them, our water supply will dry up in no time.  If you want to get in our good graces, then you'll help us bring justice to those nomads!Head east of here and bring down ten Wastewander Bandits and Thieves, then report back to me on the double.  Justice waits for no man... goblin... bah, just get on it!"
1691,"We need you to take on the stronger ranks of the Wastewander nomads now.  You've done a good job thus far, but if we are to take back those water wells, then it only makes sense to do it against as few nomads as possible!This time around we need you to take down their rogues, assassins, and shadow mages.  You'll find them east and southeast of here.I'm not going to lie to you - they're a nasty lot.  Do this for us though, and we'll be on our way to taking back what is rightfully ours!"
1692,"I have placed the elunite you gathered into a case.  Take it to the blacksmith Mathiel, and he will craft for you an elunite weapon.Mathiel is to the south, on the other side of this building."
1698,"Yorus Barleybrew has issued a challenge to all able warriors of the Alliance.  He waits at the Lakeshire Inn, in Redridge, and pledges a grand reward to anyone able to pass his trial."
1699,"I call my challenge the Rethban Gauntlet.  To pass the trial, all you must do is enter the Rethban Caverns, to the first fork, then return here.  Easy!  Except there are a few wrinkles...You have to return within an hour.There are whole heaps of Redridge Gnolls in the way.Before you start, you have to take a swig of my family's signature drink: Barleybrew Scalder!So what do you say?  The Rethban Caverns are in the foothills north of Lakeshire.  Are you ready to run the Rethban Gauntlet?"
1700,"I made a copy of my notes on the techniques I learned while making your armor, and I need them sent to Grimand Elmore.  He's here in the Dwarven District, in the weapon shop.And duck when you give these to him.  He's fiercely proud of his skills, and won't like the idea of learning something from me..."
1701,"So I gave you a nice shield, but we don't have to stop there.  I know the secrets to make extremely hard mail armor.  It's not easy and it takes very rare materials, but if you're willing to do the legwork then I'll make a piece for you.What do you say, <name>?  If you're up for the challenge, then I'll give you a list of what to get and where to get them."
1702,"You really showed what you were made of when you ran the Rethban Gauntlet, <name>.  And I'm true to my word.  I'll get you the reward I promised...Except it's in Stormwind.Talk to my friend, Furen Longbeard, in the Dwarven District of Stormwind.  He's the best shieldsmith you'll ever meet, and he owes me a big favor.Here, take Furen this cask of Barleybrew Scalder and ask him for a shield.  He'll give you a nice one."
1703,"I made a copy of my notes on the techniques I learned while making your armor, and need them sent to the blacksmith Mathiel.  He lives in Darnassus which is quite a long way off, but I'm sure he'll be very grateful to learn what I've learned."
1704,"I made a copy of my notes on the techniques I learned while making your armor, and need someone to take them to Klockmort Spannerspan.  He's a gnomish blacksmith in Ironforge and when he learns what I've learned... I bet he'll pull off his own beard in excitement."
1705,"I hate to admit that Furen might have really found something.  But to be sure I'll need to try his techniques on a new piece of armor.  If you help me with the materials, <name>, then you can have the armor.To make this armor, I need samples of burning blood and a burning rock.The only place I know to get them is Duskwood.  The Nightbane worgen based in the Roland's Doom mine have burning blood, and their leader Gutspill will have the rock.May fortune grant you speed, <name>."
1707,"Greetings <name> - the name's Luglunket, and we've got an important job for you if you're up for it!  Huzzah!Nothing would please me more as a seasoned spigot operator to take any Wastewander water pouches you might find out in the desert.  That's our water anyway - the nomads have just stolen it is all!  The Gadgetzan Water Company will offer you an official care package for every five you turn in.  Most importantly though, you're helping Gadgetzan help itself!"
1708,"I want to try Furen Longbeard's new techniques on my own piece of armor.  And because you helped Furen and he helped me, you're welcome to the armor after I make it!To finish the piece, I need a special coral, searing coral.  It grows in only one place--along the coast south of Menethil Harbor in the Wetlands.Bring me enough searing coral and I'll get right to work on the armor.  And hurry, <name>.  I'm so eager to get started it's making my toes twist!"
1710,"My colleague, Furen Longbeard, made a discovery which I am eager to test.  I wish to try it on a new armor that I am researching, for I believe Furen's techniques will produce superior results.Will you help me?  If you gather what I need to make the armor, then I will make an extra piece for you.I need the sunscorched egg shells of the Highperch Wyverns who dwell at Highperch, in Thousand Needles.  Search for the shells below their nests, and return to me when you have a sufficient amount."
1712,"I have spent ages watching this site.  I watch, so that one day I might see the great Cyclonian fall.  But I have not yet found a champion to defeat the wind lord.Perhaps you are that champion.Prove it to me.  Gather the items I need to summon Cyclonian, and I will know you are a great warrior.  Perhaps then you can defeat him and gain his whirlwind heart.If so, then I will infuse the heart's power in a weapon, and I will give that weapon to you.Here is a parchment with the items I need."
1713,"I am ready to perform the ritual to summon Cyclonian.  When he is summoned, you must defeat him and take his whirlwind heart.  This I will use to instill a weapon with Cyclonian's power.<name>, are you ready to face the wind lord?"
1715,"Hmph. Times past, all warlocks in Khaz Modan were trained under the auspices of the masters of Gnomeregan, but now that we've all been forced to relocate into this rat's hole in Ironforge, and Magni's decided to keep a careful watch on us, we're forced to send our novices to Stormwind for training.Luckily, Gakin's no slouch, so you'll still learn what you need to know, but it burns my blood!Anyways, you'll find Gakin in the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb in Stormwind."
1716,"A succubus is a devourer of souls, destroyer of hearts, and dominator of minds. It knows nothing but evil.This will be the creature you will learn to summon and control, but it cannot be brought into our world without a stimulus.With a symbol of love as bait, it will surely answer your call. Then you can defeat it, and make it your tool.It will be hard to find something of this nature, though. You should speak with Takar the Seer. You will find him in the Barrens of Kalimdor near Camp Taurajo."
1717,"<name>! Didn't expect to see you around these parts, but I was instructed to keep an eye out for you.It's past time you got some more training, so you should stop in to see Gakin the next time you're in Stormwind. He'll be waiting for you."
1718,"Your renown as a warrior grows, <name>.  Now it is time to pit yourself against your peers and see where you stand."
1719,"If you want to learn from me, then you must first pass The Affray.  It is a challenge we on Fray Island like to offer rising warriors who think they're tough, and if you can pass this test then I'll know you are.To begin, walk into the middle of that crowd yonder and step on the grate.  That'll tell Twiggy Flathead you're ready, and he'll send challengers against you.Beat all the challengers and he'll call out Big Will.  Kill Big Will, and return to me in the time we allow."
1738,"In preparation for your coming, I used my sight to look over the world and through the mists of time. I have found what it is you seek.In the War of the Ancients, two lovers fell together in battle. Where they took their last breaths, a tree known as the heartswood grew, a symbol of their undying love.That should be enough to tempt a succubus. You will find it in the ruins of Ordil'Aran in the northwestern part of the forest of Ashenvale."
1739,"Using the heartswood core, you will be able to cast a spell at the summoning circle in the crypt below to open a portal for the succubus to pass through.Be careful, <name>, succubi have overrun even the strongest of minds.Once you have bested and returned it to the void, return to me and I will show you how to call and control it."
1740,"When demons of the Legion fall out of favor, their spirits are imprisoned within orbs and distributed to their mages and warlocks.Many were carried by their servants in Azeroth. Even fragmented, they still possess the powers of the demons trapped inside.The orb of Soran'ruk was broken into two pieces, one was further broken to be used by the acolytes of the Twilight's Hammer in Blackfathom Deeps. The other, larger piece, was possessed by a wizard in Shadowfang Keep. Find them and I can reform it."
1758,"It will take more than a simple summoning circle to bring forth a felhunter for you to challenge.My three acolytes and I will assist in creating the magic circles. You require a copy of the Tome of the Cabal, which has been lost to us for some time. It was written by the first group of warlocks to summon a felhunter unaided.Perhaps Krom Stoutarm can help you with this. An itinerant warlock these days, he spends his days hoarding ancient texts and skulking about the library in Ironforge."
1778,"I'm going to see about making plans to return home soon. Hopefully, Stephanie is doing well back in Stormwind. I can't wait to see her again. Till next we meet, <class>."
1779,"I want you to take this, <name>. It is called the Symbol of Life.You've proven charitable and patient, and now I want you to prove just how adept you've become in both combat, and power.My husband Muiredon returned recently from an encounter with some Dark Iron dwarves, and he barely escaped with his life--he's over there having his wounds healed by one of our priests.Take the Symbol and speak to him. If you can help him, then we will speak again soon. May the Light shine upon you."
1780,"I'll take these to the children this very day. Please be safe, good <class>. It is not often < men/women> of your character show their faces in the city, but you've proven that the paladins here in Stormwind shall never turn their backs on those in need.Farewell."
1781,"Take this, <name>. It is called the Symbol of Life.You've proven charitable and patient, and now the time has come to see if you're powerful enough to focus one of the Light's greatest gifts.My friend Gazin returned recently from an encounter with some Defias in Elwynn near Heroes' Vigil--he barely escaped with his life. He's near the altar having his wounds healed by our priests.Take the Symbol and speak to him. If you can help him, then we will speak again soon. May you bask in the Light's glory."
1783,"We was spyin' on some of the Dark Iron dwarves that've bunkered down south of Helm's Bed Lake. We knew they was up to no good, so Narm an' me thought we'd take a closer look-got ta see their leader given orders to some o' his men.Narm an' me took the chance to kill a few of 'em, but they proved tougher than we thought, an' more of 'em got the jump on us. Narm tol' me to run an' get support, so 'ere I am.Narm needs help, an' I'll not rest till he gets it.C'n ya help, <name>?"
1784,"Before I fell in battle, Muiredon and I had almost defeated one of the Dark Iron spies near that small house. We witnessed their captain passing orders to them, and sought to kill him and take the orders.Some of the council in Ironforge do not yet believe the presence of Dark Iron dwarves exists in Dun Morogh. By attaining one of those scripts, we'll not only have proof of their movements, but possibly an idea of what they're planning.Get one of those scripts and take it back to Muiredon, <name>."
1785,"I c'n see me wife's o'er there beamin' wit pride already. Ya better get yer tuchus o'er there pronto. I be thinkin' she'd have some words wit ya.Light be witcha, mighty <class>. I'll be lookin' fer ya on the battlefield against the Scourge and dem Dark Irons when the time comes."
1786,"Henze and I had made it to Heroes' Vigil, an island in the middle of Stone Cairn Lake in northeastern Elwynn. We'd heard the Defias had infiltrated our borders and we wanted proof to take to the king's advisors.We caught sight of a couple of the scum going over some documents, and we attacked. Unfortunately, we were quickly overwhelmed by more of the mages.Henze held them off for me while I escaped... the daft fool, going and being brave.He's out there now, Henze is. Can you help us, <name>?"
1787,"We'll have time to talk more about the Symbol at a later time. What's important now is to get those papers we saw the Defias going over. If we can get our hands on them, we'll be able to prove the Defias have infiltrated Elwynn and hopefully gain some insight into what their plans are.I'm in no shape for battle as of now, <name>. Do you think you're strong enough to get those papers from the Defias here on the island?If you're able to get them, bring them back to Gazin and let him know I'm all right."
1788,"I'll take the script to the King's advisors after Duthorian's taken a look at them, but in the meantime, you should go speak to Duthorian now. He'll be wanting to pat you on the back for sure!Thank you again, <name>. I hope we meet again. You're surely an ally I'm proud to call friend."
1791,"Now that you've learned your berserker's stance, you'll want a nice weapon to use it with.Talk to Bath'rah the Windwatcher, a troll hermit who lives between the Alterac Mountains and the Western Plaguelands.  He is a skilled weapon maker and a powerful shaman.To find Bath'rah, go to the river that flows along Tarren Mill's eastern flank.  Follow it north--Bath'rah is camped near ruins that rest along the river's eastern bank."
1795,"If you are sufficiently prepared, then we should begin. Let me explain the process to you.I will begin by creating the basic summoning circle. When that is finished, my acolytes will use the rods of channeling to create the greater circle.Once that is done, read the incantation from the Tome of the Cabal, and the felhunter will be pulled forth. Be careful, <name>. A felhunter is a powerful foe, and I'd like to see you keep your head on your shoulders."
1796,"The first item I will aid you in creating is a robe. You will gather the items for me, and we will put them together. Afterwards, assuming you succeed, you will have the first of many items that will make you more powerful and aid you in your struggles.To start, you must have crafted Robes of Arcana. A tailor can make this for you, or perhaps you can purchase one from someone else--I'd be most impressed if you could make it yourself--but regardless, bring me the robes, and we shall go from there."
1798,"It is time you learned the felhunter summoning, <name>. I do not have the reagents and items necessary to teach you here, so you will have to seek out another, Strahad Farsan, another of our inner circle.He makes his residence in the goblin port of Ratchet. I will send word ahead of you to inform him of your coming."
1799,"Good, then we shall begin.The first thing you must do is speak to my acolytes inside. Choose one of their paths to follow--they will explain more.Second, you must travel to Desolace and find an Infernal Orb from one of the warlocks of Mannoroc Coven. It is that orb that you will cleanse with the help of a mage named Tabetha deep in southern Dustwallow Marsh. She will aid you because of our history together.Again, do not come back until you have done both things I've asked."
1800,"The orphan matrons at my home tell mighty stories of battle and lore at night if we are good and do our chores.  One story was about how Lordaeron fell, and about how the evil Arthas took his own father's life to become ruler.He had no honor, <name>!  When I grow up and become a mighty Horde warrior, my blade will be guided by honor - never evil!Would you take me to see the throne room, please?  It is just before where you would go down into the Undercity."
1801,"It will take more than a simple summoning circle to bring forth a felhunter for you to challenge.My three acolytes and I will assist in creating the magic circles. You require a copy of the Tome of the Cabal, which has been lost to us for some time. It was written by the first group of warlocks to summon a felhunter unaided.Perhaps Jorah Annison can help you with this. He's employed as a cartographer in the Undercity these days, but still knows more of ancient texts than any I know."
1802,"It was lost, but there's some idea as to where it might be found.There was only one copy ever made and it was vandalized at some point, a large portion of it ripped from the binding. Rumor has it that it somehow passed into the hands of the centaur of Thousand Needles.The rest was lost off the coast west of Southshore, where it was to be transported to Menethil Harbor by boat. It never arrived.In exchange for this knowledge, all I ask is that if you find it, bring it to me to see."
1803,"Ah! I see that you are a warlock of similar tastes to mine. Indeed, acquiring the Tome of the Cabal is a worthy aspiration. Did you know that it was once held within the walls of Lordaeron? It was vandalized though, almost half its pages removed. Who would commit such a heinous act?That half is lost, though rumor says that it fell into the hands of the centaur of the Thousand Needles.The rest of the text was to be transferred to Ironforge, but was lost in transit on the coast west of Southshore."
1804,"Well, ah, it's hard to let it go. But you found it, and you have more important things to do with it, of course. Just, please, be sure to mention to Strahad that I wanted a copy.While you were out, he sent a message for you. He wanted me to tell you that for his acolytes to assist with the summoning, you'll have to acquire three rods of channeling.He might not know where to find them, but I do! They were last used by the orcs of the Dragonmaw clan in the Wetlands. I'd check their spellcasters!"
1805,"This is one of the most interesting texts I have perused in the last few years. The selection here is sparse--mostly books on geography--and I have already read them all. I should hope that Strahad would send me a copy of this tome when he has the chance.Speaking of him, he sent word to me while you were away. For your task, you must obtain three rods of channeling.For allowing me to look at this text, I will share a secret: You can find the rods on orcs of the Dragonmaw Clan in the Wetlands."
1806,"Why don't we go over to the forge and get started on this? I've been preparing for your arrival for some time, so it shouldn't take long at all.When we're done, you'll be far more prepared to defend the Light than you have been, this much I swear.I'll be somewhat honest, <name>, seeing the results of your exploits makes me somewhat envious. But knowing that I can contribute to your adventures in my own significant way does bring me some joy."
1818,"I was told Deathguard Dillinger has a job for someone like you.  If you're willing to show your value to the Dark Lady's forces, then report to Dillinger immediately."
1819,"When the Scourge swept through Tirisfal Glades, we captured one to study.  He had a free mind, and called himself Ulag the Cleaver.  But, although his will was free, he was still enthralled by the Lich King.We hoped to find a way to break the king's control over Ulag, but we failed.  Now, finally, it is time to free him.Free him, and kill him.Activate the skull stone trigger near the mausoleum to the north.  This will lift the magical seal that binds him.Then... be ready, <name>."
1820,"You have proven your value to the Dark Lady, now perhaps you can prove yourself to one of her subjects.Coleman Farthing awaits a warrior who is willing to be his instrument of revenge against the Forsaken's enemies.You will find him in the Gallow's End Tavern in eastern Brill."
1821,"The Agamand family were my employers in life, and they were the cause of my death!  It is fitting that the Agamands are now mindless minions of the Lich King.Now I would have their last vestiges of honor.  Go into their family crypt and rob them of their family heirlooms: a sword, an axe, a dagger and a mace.  Bring them to me!The Agamand family crypt is at the north end of the Agamand mills, protected by lurking scourge and dead Agamands."
1823,"You are a warrior of skill and growing renown.  Perhaps you are ready for Ruga Ragetotem's trial?  If so, then find Ruga in Camp Taurajo in the Barrens.He awaits those warriors who answer his call."
1824,"To pass this trial, you must travel south to the Field of Giants.  There you will find a host of crawling, insect creatures.  They are new to the Barrens and I do not like what they herald.Bring me their still-twitching antennae, and waste no time, <name>, for harvested antennae will not twitch for long.  Bring me the antennae in the time allowed, and you will pass the trial."
1825,"Thun'grim Firegaze, an orc blacksmith of renown, has heard of your continued deeds of valor in service of the Horde.  He would like to fashion for you a suit of armor, and bids you speak with him immediately.Thun'grim is camped east of the Crossroads in the Barrens."
1838,"I have heard tales of your strength and valor, and wish to make for you a suit of armor, a companion to aid you as tales of your great deeds grow.But the fashioning of this armor will be a quest unto itself, <name>.  I will need your help, and the help of other smiths of the Horde.Here, take this scroll.  I spent many nights, struggling with near-blind eyes, writing that which I need for the armor.  Bring me the items on this scroll and I will create for you the first piece of the suit."
1839,"The troll smith Ula'elek will craft for you the brutal gauntlets.  He dwells in Durotar, in Sen'jin Village with his Darkspear brethren, and he awaits your coming."
1840,"Orm Stonehoof is respected greatly for his skill.  He will make for you the brutal helm.Seek him out in Thunder Bluff, near the pool by the city's great, central totem."
1841,"It is said that, before her death, Velora Nitely was one of the finest armorsmiths in Lordaeron.  Death, it seems, has not decreased her talents.  Speak with Velora--she will make your brutal legguards.Velora plies her trade in the Undercity of Lordaeron, in the trade quarter."
1842,"I can make you a pair of brutal gauntlets, and great magic will they hold.  But first, you must collect this magic and bring it to me.The satyrs dwell in northeastern Ashenvale because of the forest's power.  They feed off its purity, leeching and corrupting.  You can tell which satyrs have drawn the most of Ashenvale's magic by their swollen, uncloven hooves.These hooves hold great power.  I will need them for your gauntlets' crafting."
1844,"I will make you the helm, but you must show me you are worthy of it.Nestled in the northwestern reaches of the Stonetalon Mountains there lies the Charred Vale.  It was once a verdant place, but is now defiled and ashen, and what creatures remain there are mad with pain and despair.That place is where I send you, <name>.You must go to the Charred Vale and find a chimaera matriarch.  Slay her, free her of her misery.  Bring me her galvanized horn as proof, and I shall make for you the helm."
1846,"To make the brutal leg guards, I need a brace of sturdy shinbones.  The Dragonmaw orcs of the Wetlands have nice, thick shinbones.  I'll need theirs.But they must be sturdy.  Be sure to test the shinbones as you collect them.  If you can break them with your bare hands, then they won't be sturdy enough to work with."
1858,"I'll leave it to you to get Tazan's satchel open, and return to me with its contents. The locking mechanism is complex, so it would probably be easiest if you obtained the key.As you didn't find it on Tazan's body, I can only assume that he left the key in the care of another... Ah, yes, that's right. He had an assistant named Gamon. A drunkard, you'll most likely find him at the tavern. Perhaps you could quietly relieve him of the key."
1859,"Lower your voice, <name>. Yeah, I know your name. Was told to keep an eye out for an orc by your description.From what we've heard about you, you can handle yourself in combat, and aren't opposed to a little sneakery from time to time.Am I right?Anyways, you should go see Therzok in Orgrimmar. He's got an offer for you to hear."
1860,"We mages have a task that needs doing.  One that is vital to the safety of Stormwind and Elwynn forest.Jennea Cannon has the details.  She studies in the wizard's sanctum, in the mage district of Stormwind.  You should make your way to her with haste."
1861,"This world has been victim to massive mystic struggles, which tore magic currents from once stable channels.  We struggle to determine the effects these changes have caused, and some of us fear the worst!But I will reveal more of this later.  Right now, we need you to gather information.Here, take this flask.  Go to the base of the waterfall at Mirror Lake, southwest of the Stormwind gates, and retrieve a sample of the water there.  Return it to me so that I might test it for magical taints."
1879,"<name>!  Bink, my gnome colleague in Ironforge, sends word.  She has a task that needs doing and won't rely on anyone but a mage to do it!  Are you that mage, <name>?If so, then speak with Bink.  She spends her time in the Hall of Mysteries in the Mystic Ward of Ironforge."
1880,"We mages do more than just waggle our fingers and make pretty sparks!  We control magic, the base fabric of our world!  And that takes great care, and resolve.  And knowledge... so much knowledge!One of my devices, the mage-tastic gizmonitor, collects and stores that knowledge in huge amounts!  But it's lost!  When we fled our home of Gnomeregan, I left it in a chest in one of our huts outside the city, and now the place is crawling with leper gnomes!Please, <name>, retrieve my gizmonitor!"
1881,"<name>, Anastasia Hartwell has a task for someone of your talents.  Speak with her in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity, and prepare yourself for your first task for the mages of the Forsaken."
1882,"The Plaguelands to the east are an aberration.  Devised by the Lich King, they spread their magic into the soil, corrupting and killing all that live.  Although there is a certain charm to the destructive forces of the plague, we, the mages of the Forsaken, believe it is unruly and must be curtailed.But first, we must measure how far it has spread into Tirisfal.  Go to the Balnir Farmstead in eastern Tirisfal.  In the garden are flowers--snapdragons.  Gather these and return."
1883,"Un'thuwa, tribal mage of Sen'jin Village, detects a disturbance in the magic currents of Durotar and asks for aid.  Speak with Un'thuwa and do what you can to help him.Do this, and in time further secrets will be revealed to you."
1884,"The warlock Zalazane of the Echo Isles has disrupted the normal flow of magic in Durotar.  He does this through tainted fetishes, ju-ju heaps, which he has placed among his huts on the main Echo Isle.These heaps corrupt our wildlife and give power to the warlocks and infernal creatures that lurk in the land's dark corners.You must destroy the ju-ju heaps, <name>, before the flow of magic is forever altered."
1885,"<name>? Not quite what I was expecting, considering Carkad himself has taken an interest to you. Looks can be deceiving though, right?Either way, you should go see him as soon as possible. You wouldn't want to know what happened to the last few that chose to ignore his summons."
1886,"If you wish to join the Deathstalkers, Lord Varimathras' elite guard, you will have to prove your worth.I will not lie to you, <name>, this task could mean your death.I have some things that need attending to. I require the personal effects of Astor Hadren, a messenger who travels between Silverpine and the Undercity. I will leave the method of procurement to your discretion.It will be better for you if you know less of the nature of this business. Succeed and I shall tell you more."
1898,"The letter of introduction should be enough to convince Andron that you are the messenger he's been waiting for. I've met Andron before, he doesn't quite have the mental capacity to be that suspicious.Lord Varimathras suspects that Andron has been providing aid to some other group. He wishes to know what organization this is and requires proof of it.I want you to speak with Andron, and obtain this information. You'll find him at his shop near the Apothecarium."
1899,"You'll find the ledger with the information your employers seek on the bookshelf behind me. Deliver it with my regards, and tell them that I would prefer it if they sent you, if they find enough value that they should wish to continue our arrangement."
1918,"The slain elemental has produced an intensely glowing globe of water.  The contents of the globe are, at best, disgusting.  It would be safe to assume that whatever has befouled the water of Mystral Lake is most likely present in the water of the globe.It's not exactly common knowledge who might be interested in such a find; perhaps the person who originally sent you out to the lake, Mastok Wrilehiss at Splintertree Post, might have an idea."
1919,"Your knowledge of the craft grows, young <name>.  Are you now ready to begin your true lessons?  Are you ready to take your place in the secret war we wage?If so, then speak with Jennea Cannon, in the wizard's sanctum in the mage district of Stormwind.  She has a task for you which will open your first window into the invisible world."
1920,"A disturbance has been reported at the Blue Recluse tavern in the Mage Quarter.  Strange, invisible creatures now wander the tavern, and I fear a mana rift has formed there.I want you to investigate the tavern and capture those creatures.  Use the cantation of manifestation in the tavern to make the creatures visible, subdue them then use a containment coffer to capture them.  When you have enough, return to me with your filled coffers, your empty coffers and the cantation."
1921,"You have served your fellow mages well, and now it is time to don your wizard's robe.  Wynne Larson can make your robe, but you must bring her the needed materialsThe robe will be made of linen which is easy to find, but you must also gain charged rift gems, and the only known location of the gems is in the Silver Stream Mine of Loch Modan, left in crates by the dwarven miners' league.Gather the linen and the gems and bring them to Wynne Larson at the Larson Clothiers in the Mage District."
1938,"Long ago, three mages studied in this tower until one fell to the dark arts.  He was urged to turn away from that evil magic, but he could not resist.  And so he was banished.The fallen mage's new domain is the tower of Ilgalar in Redridge, and he took with him a powerful book--Ur's Treatise on Shadow Magic.We, the mages of Stormwind, would have that book returned.  Enter the tower of Ilgalar, find the tome in his library, and bring it to me."
1939,"High Sorcerer Andromath wishes to speak with you, <name>.  He is at the top of the wizard's sanctum, in the mage's district of Stormwind.It would be wise to speak with him, for Andromath is one of the most powerful mages not locked away in Dalaran.  Council with him is high council indeed."
1940,"Your service has been unwavering, <name>.  I think, perhaps, it is time you had a finer garment, one more suiting your station as an adept mage.  If you gather the needed materials, then we will arrange the robe made.You must enter Duskwood and hunt carrion recluse spiders.  Extract their silk, but only the finest, most pristine silk will do.  When you have enough, take it to Wynne Larson, here in the mage district at the Larson Clothiers.  She will craft your robe."
1943,"The troll mage Deino has need of your assistance, <name>.  She resides in Orgrimmar, in the Darkbriar Lodge."
1944,"The fabled city of Xavian lies nestled deep within eastern Ashenvale, and tales of its ancient knowledge are well known among the learned.  It is said that the waters of Xavian hold vast magical powers.I would have a sample of those waters, from their source.Take this flask and go to Xavian.  Gather water from the bottom of its highest waterfall, and return to me.  And use care as you move through that ancient city--satyrs now hold the ruins and do not like mages prying into their affairs."
1945,"For your services, I have arranged for the creation of your new robes, provided you can gather the needed materials...For these robes, you must return to Ashenvale for the locks of hair from laughing sisters--dryads who gather near the Raynewood Retreat.When you have their hair, bring it to Kil'hala, a troll tailor at the Crossroads in the Barrens.  He will be expecting you, and will fashion your robes."
1947,"Now it is time for you to earn your mage's wand.  To begin this quest, speak with the human hermit Tabetha in Dustwallow Marsh.  You will find her shack deep in the marsh, west of Theramore."
1948,"The building of a mage's wand is not easy.  Rare substances are required, and a vessel must be made that can store great quantities of magical energy.  You must gather these things and bring them to me.I have written onto this parchment that which you need, and instructions on how to get it.  Bring me exactly what is on this list, and follow my written directions to the letter, for if you do not then when we make your wand things might go... badly."
1949,"To make your wand, there are key passages in a certain book that I must read.  The book is called Rituals of Power, written by the Magus Tirth.I do not have a copy of his book, and none of the world's great libraries possess it.  So you must speak with Tirth and gain it from him.Good luck.  Tirth used to be a great mage and scholar, but now he spends his time at the gnome and goblin races in the Shimmering Flats, drinking and gambling."
1950,"I can help you with the book, but first you have to help me!The tome you seek is in my magically locked strongbox.  To open it a special phrase must be uttered, and I can't remember the phrase!  Normally my assistant helps me remember these things but he's nowhere to be found.If you want my book, then find my apprentice!  Ask around the race track--if you're lucky then someone has seen him.  Either drag him back here, or at least get my magic phrase from him so we can open my box!"
1951,"Hm... now that I think about it, I don't have my book!  You see, I had some gambling debts and to pay them off I sold the last copy of Rituals of Power to a member of the clergy....A member of the Scarlet Brotherhood.  He must have taken it to their library in the Scarlet Monastery in Tirisfal Glades!If you want that book, then you'll have to go to the monastery to find it.  And sorry about all the trouble.  I'm not myself these days..."
1952,I'll go make the wands now.
1953,"It is time, <name>, for you to speak with Tabetha... the hermit of Dustwallow Marsh.  She will instruct you on the creation of a powerful mage's implement."
1954,"The first step is to acquire an orb with power.  The warlocks of the Burning Blade have nice, high quality orbs... it's too bad they've bound demons into them!  But we can fix that, yes we can.Go to Desolace and snatch an infernal orb from a Burning Blade summoner.  You'll find summoners at the Mannoroc Coven.When you have the orb, return to me."
1955,"Now that we have a summoner's orb, we must exorcise the demon within it.  I can do that.  That's the easy part.You're the one who has the hard job.  You're the one who has to kill the demon once it's out.And you'll have to be quick.  If you take too long then he'll jump back in the orb and we'll have to start over!So get yourself ready.  Prepare your strongest spells and keep your potions handy, and go get a friend if you have one.  Because this isn't going to be pretty."
1956,"Now that the demon has been removed, we must gain a power source.  Unfortunately, the best power sources are usually the oldest and the hardest to get.  It's neat how fate likes to take a bite out of you sometimes, isn't it?So you're going to need to go to Uldaman and defeat the obsidian sentinel there.  He's big, he's tough, and his power source packs a punch!I wish you the best of luck, <name>.  And if you don't get lucky then, well... it was nice knowing you."
1957,"We are almost finished, but this last step is the most perilous, <name>.I have the empty summoner's orb and am ready to empower it.  We will do this by harnessing the energy of a mana rift.  I'll cast a spell that will temporarily open a rift, from which creatures, mana surges, will pour out.  You must defeat the mana surges and their power will be released, which I will then collect.Kill enough mana surges before the rift closes and I will place all their collected energy in your orb."
1959,"The mages of the Undercity have noted a magical disturbance within the city, and have sent word for mages of the Horde to investigate.Anastasia Hartwell can tell you more.  Speak with her in the Magic Quarter in the Undercity."
1960,"Algernon's alchemist shop in the Apothecarium is the locus of a strange disturbance.  Invisible creatures, made solely of magic, wander the shop--there must be a reason, and we must find it!Investigate the disturbance and capture those creatures.  Take a chest of coffers and a scroll from behind me.  Use the scroll at the shop to make the creatures visible, subdue them with your spells, then throw down a coffer to capture them.  Return with the filled coffers, the empty coffers and the cantation."
1961,"It is time for you to don your first mage's robes, <name>.  They are a sign of your station, and a testament to your worth.To gain the robes, you must gather the mana gems from the Dalaran mages of Silverpine.  Their beliefs are similar to ours and so killing them is somewhat distasteful, but if they lack the strength to resist us, then they do not deserve their lives.Bring the gems and a supply of linen to Josef Gregorian at the Magic Quarter's tailor shop."
1963,"The Warchief is too subtle in his methods. He is cautious to unleash the might of the Horde. Once we were stronger, mighty conquerors all. That pride we must regain, and the Shattered Hand will do so.We build strength from the shadows and strike at the exposed, secretly laying our enemies low. A task you must complete for me, to prove your worth.The troll Tazan trades with the pirates near Ratchet. He has information I must have. Kill him and bring me his satchel."
1978,"The Syndicate? I would never have suspected. It seems the lords of Alterac have fallen far in the years since their betrayal.Lord Varimathras will be pleased to learn of this, and as you were so instrumental in this discovery, it would be fitting if you were the one to deliver it to him.Ah, and how could I forget?Welcome to the Deathstalkers."
1998,"Lord Varimathras has just sent me a missive about a threat to the Forsaken that must be immediately removed. His name is Fenwick Thatros, one whom Lord Varimathras believes is a leader of the undead that have taken root in Silverpine Forest.Your name came to mind immediately, <name>. I have faith enough in your abilities that you will carry out this mission flawlessly.The latest reports from the Deathstalkers in Silverpine indicate that Thatros can be found near the decrepit dock on Lordamere."
1999,"The wizards of the Kirin Tor at Ambermill have stored away important documents pertaining to the current state of Dalaran. This we know from the admissions of one of our prisoners. Lord Varimathras has placed the duty of recovering them in the hands of the Deathstalkers.This task falls to you, <name>. You will need some equipment, however, and the knowledge of lockpicking. Speak with Estelle Gendry, our outfitter, and ask her for a set of tools before you set out."
2038,"As if crashing into the Loch wasn't bad enough, troggs from the nearby island attacked me and stole my tools and special Blastenheimer Blastencapper explosives. With no gyrocopter and no explosives, the movement has no chance!Get my tools back and find my Blastencapper explosives, <name>. For Gnomeregan!"
2039,"We've lost contact with Bingles! He was sent on a reconnaissance mission over Gnomeregan and hasn't reported back in over a week. I just know he's gone and blown himself up.He was last seen flying over the Loch. Perhaps you can investigate, <name>."
2040,"Gnomeregan has fallen under the control of those dastardly troggs! The situation is grave but perhaps you can help, <name>.Deep in the Deadmines is a functional goblin shredder. Find that shredder and bring back the intact power supply. With the shredder's power supply, we can give our gyrodrillmatic excavationators the power they need to break through the rocky underground borders of Gnomeregan, opening the way for a gnomish assault!"
2041,"Perhaps... Perhaps you can help us in the battle for Gnomeregan.In Stormwind you will find the commander of our underground assault crew, Shoni the Shilent. Shoni needs assistance with her gyrodrillmatic excavationators.You will probably find her amongst the dwarves in Stormwind.Good luck, <name>."
2078,"Landlubber, ye needs to find me first mate.Take this'n key, puts it in his gulliver an' bring him back here to serve the Cap'n.Them murlocs an' their chief ain't gonna be too happy once me first mate gets a hold of em!"
2098,"A pirate's life ain't an easy one, landlubber. It ain't all about plunderin' and booze! Alas, me ship be sunk just off shore thanks to them pesky Threshadons.What I be needin' is me first mate back in workin' order!When I washed up'n shore, the key for me first mate broke on the rocks and was pilfered by the beasties of Darkshore. Out of the corner of me eyes I saw some of them Ragin' Crawlers, Ferocious Foreststrider, and murloc rummaging through the wreckage...."
2118,"A sickness spreads across the Darkshore, gripping the minds and bodies of all it touches.The Thistle Bears have been hit the hardest by this plague. The once noble beasts are now an instrument of destruction - rabid and frenzied. I may have a cure for this ailment.Take this trap to the forest and lay it on the ground. Any Rabid Thistle Bear that crosses the light shall become docile for a short time. Once the bear is docile, it shall follow you. Lead it back here, <name>."
2138,"As I had feared, the cure does not work.It saddens me greatly to order the death of any of nature's beasts, but the sick and tainted thistle bears must be put down.Return to the forest and destroy 20 rabid thistle bears, <name>. It will most certainly not put a stop to the plague but it will slow down the damage the animals are doing to our forest and its inhabitants for a short time."
2139,"The survival of our people and lands comes at unfortunate costs, <name>.You have spilled the blood of nature's servants; many sick animals you have felled. The people of Auberdine are indebted to you, for the forest's pain is eased - even if only for a moment.I have one final task for you, but be warned, you will have to kill again. It is my hope that this will be the last time I call upon you, <name>.In a cave to the northeast, near Bashal'Aran, resides the Den Mother. Slay her."
2158,"Every adventurer should rest when exhaustion sets in - and there is no finer place to get rest and relaxation than at the Lion's Pride Inn!My best friend, Innkeeper Farley, runs the Lion's Pride. If you tell him I sent you, he may give you the special discounted rates on food and drink.To find the Lion's Pride Inn, travel south along the road from here -- you can't miss it!"
2159,"Greetings, young <class>.  Can you offer me aid?  I have a package of herbs that I must deliver to the town of Dolanaar.  But I still have business with the druids of Shadowglen and cannot yet leave.Can you deliver this package for me?  It must be sent to Innkeeper Keldamyr, at the Dolanaar inn.  It lies along the road, to the south."
2160,"Hey! You look like a hearty adventurer. If you're planning on braving the pass, do you suppose you could bring a package to the inn in Kharanos?You were planning on stopping at the inn, right? If you make it through the pass, you'll definitely want to take a breather there.Anyways, bring this to Tannok Frosthammer, the innkeeper's assistant. I can't get through the pass myself, and it'll be days until a Mountaineer escort comes through!"
2161,"Excuse me?  Can you help me?I have a load of food here.  I walked along the road and braved scorpids and spiders and worse!  I brought the food to the Valley of Trials because I thought they needed it and I like to help out.  But they don't need any food!  Now I have to take it back to Razor Hill and I'm afraid of all the beasts along the way...Can you take it for me?  I'm just a peon, but you're a hero.  You fear nothing!Take it to Innkeeper Grosk at the Razor Hill inn.  Thank you!"
2178,"Do you smell that delicious aroma? It's my secret recipe, <name>--fresh strider stew. Delicious!Perhaps you would be interested in learning the recipe?Before I teach you the recipe, you will need to prove that you can handle the beasts.Now, I don't expect you to go out and tame one and ride it back to me, but if you can kill a few and bring back some of their succulent meat, I may be persuaded to show you the ways of strider stew."
2198,"You have found a tarnished necklace, though the tarnish belies intricate and magical craftsmanship.  The necklace has been shattered, as its setting appears to be missing three gems.  On the underside of the necklace is the faint imprint of the city seal for Ironforge.  Below the seal are three tiny, engraved letters: ""TdK"".If there is anything to be gleaned from the necklace, you will need to learn about its origins.  Perhaps the seal and the initials are a start..."
2199,"I am a jeweler of great renown here in Ironforge!  Well, former renown anyway... I have fallen onto hard times due to the chicanery of a competitor!  A bad reputation in this business spells financial disaster.  As a result, I find myself without a copper to my good-though-currently-sullied name.I want you to get me five silver bars to finish an order I received - the first in what seems like an eternity.You get me those five silver bars, and I'll answer your questions on the necklace."
2200,"A competitor of mine started a rumor that my necklace cursed the paladin.  Needless to say, no one wants to buy cursed items from a jeweler.<name>, I'll make you a deal - find the gems and I'll reassemble the necklace, so long as you'll advertise that I do NOT make cursed items!Try looking for clues in Uldaman; maybe see if the paladin's body is down there, since he's the one who we know had it last!  When you find the gems you should use this; it'll allow you to contact me here in Ironforge."
2201,"The paladin's journal has provided perhaps the only clues that Uldaman will yield as to the location of the necklace's gems.  If the paladin's scribing remains accurate, then the Shadowforge dwarves and the troggs that vie for control of the dig site will need to be dealt with.Armed with this knowledge, the search for the gems begins in earnest.  When all the gems have been acquired, Talvash in Ironforge should be notified via the Phial of Scrying as per his instructions."
2202,"I've heard about a newly discovered plant called the magenta fungus caps.  They grow in clusters at the Uldaman dig site and can be found in the early tunnels and deep within the less-explored areas.  I want to study their potential use in alchemy, and that's where you come in.Find the magenta cap clusters and bring me a dozen caps.  Be warned, the clusters may spew out poison spores if jostled.Do this for me, and I'll whip up a batch of one of my famous restorative elixirs for you!"
2203,"You have been most helpful to me, <class>.  I would reward you with the very recipe for the brew I gave you earlier... but I would ask of you a task that is quite dangerous.  Hear my request.This lockbox contains three empty thaumaturgy vessels; they are imbued with an attunement aura that will drain the blood of a scorched guardian dragon.  Using one on the beast will anger it greatly, so be warned.  Once you have all three filled, bring them to me.Do this, and the recipe will be yours."
2204,"You are going to need to find some ""oomph"" for the necklace, and Uldaman is probably the best place for it, actually.  I guess there are a lot of constructs running around in there, yeah?  Well, take out the biggest, baddest construct in that place and grab its power source!  I am pretty sure I can fuse that source into the necklace.Without that power source, fixing the necklace will be impossible.  Come back to me here to Ironforge when you have it, and we'll get it all fixed up for you!"
2205,"The badge? Oh, it's nothing, fish - nothing you could handle anyhow. By the looks of you, I'd say Mathias is likely to mistake you for the cheese delivery < boy/girl> instead of a proper rogue. Regardless, I've been assigned a job and I've made a promise to deliver on that job.Speaking of which, deliver this package to Mathias and he may give you a small task or two.Get cracking."
2206,"Our operatives in the field are reporting heavy Defias activity south of Goldshire. The reports indicate that the Defias have taken over Jerod's Landing and are now using it as a way to smuggle large quantities of contraband from Redridge to Westfall.I need you to infiltrate the dock house and get me that shipping schedule, <name>. You will probably find it buried deep in the pockets of the Dockmaster....and <name>, should you be discovered, SI:7 will disavow all knowledge of your existence."
2218,"Another lost soul looking for guidance, eh? I suppose you want to find a purpose - your purpose. I've seen it a thousand times, another hero looking for work.Well, today's your lucky day, friend. Hogral's got the cure for your ailment.Here's what you do: Take this road here up to Ironforge and make your way to the Forlorn Cavern. Once there, locate the thieves' guild and speak with Hulfdan Blackbeard. He'll put you on the road to salvation."
2238,"Ye see, the King be strip mining the quarry fer ore and gems. More riches than any one dwarf should see in ten lifetimes.The Hidden Circle has values, <name>. We value valuables. Can ye understand?Now we feels the King should be sharing some of that booty, but we don't want ol' 'Stinkbeard' to know he's sharin' - if ye catch me drift.We needs ye to speak with Onin MacHammar over by Gnomeregan and bring back a report. The crafty dwarf has hidden hisself amongst the lepers. Be careful."
2239,"The Quarry? Yap, I see those monstrous armored steam tanks come by this post near every day.My contacts to the east tell me that the tank starts off at Ironforge, makes a pickup at the Gol'Bolar Quarry, stops over at Kharanos to refuel and then for some blasted reason, it takes the long way around past Gnomeregan, before reaching Ironforge to drop off the shipment.It's all in the report, <race>. Take it back to Hulfdan so he can plan the next step."
2240,"Now for the task at hand.There is a secret chamber, the Chamber of Khaz'mul, that must be explored.  The problem is that the chamber's behind a huge, locked door!  It's a lucky thing I know how to open it.I've described everything in my journal, here on the table.  My band and I are stuck here for now... so you, <name>, must find the chamber of Khaz'mul for us!Read my journal, explore the chamber, then report to Prospector Stormpike at the Explorers' League in Ironforge."
2241,"They say I'm 'lovestruck,' whatever that means.Sure, I spend my every waking moment thinking about Syurna. Sure, my home is full of paintings and drawings of Syurna. Sure, I often go days without eating, sleeping, or drinking, while I lament about the love we could have had. Is that so wrong?Now she won't see me! ME! I've tried sending her messages but she won't even talk to another person unless they are a rogue.Could you deliver this flower to her? Don't forget to tell her it's from Jannok."
2242,"We believe there is one being that may be able to help us understand what is happening to the forests of Teldrassil. Unfortunately, getting the creature to cooperate has proven disastrous.He hides on a branch at the outskirts of the Oracle Glade. All who have so far approached the satyr, whether through force or diplomacy, have met with doom. Perhaps stealth is the answer, <name>.Find what Sethir the Ancient carries in his packs and report back to me."
2258,"<name>, I could use your aid if you're up for it.  I am an alchemist of some note, and I seek your aid in acquiring some reagents found out in the Badlands.I need the following items to replenish my stocks: five buzzard gizzards, ten crag coyote fangs, and five rock elemental shards.  Obviously, you can get them off of the beasties themselves; if you're not the fighting type, then find friends who are.Acquire these items for me, you'll get some coin out of the deal.  Watcha wanna do?"
2259,"Do not worry, <name>, I am not sending you to see Syurna. Erion requires your presence at the Cenarion Enclave. Make haste!"
2260,"Word of your deeds has spread far and wide, <name>. So far, in fact, that Stormwind Intelligence has asked for you by name.The journey is taxing and not without peril, but an opportunity to train under SI:7 should not be taken lightly.A new world awaits you, <name>. Make your way to Old Town in Stormwind and speak with Renzik ""The Shiv"" at SI:7 headquarters."
2278,"The centerpieces of this treasure chamber are four huge platinum discs, each adorned with numerous sigils of an unknown origin.  Touching them makes your hand tingle.  Just after touching the discs, the visage of a large stone watcher springs forth.""Salutations.  I am a keeper of knowledge.  The Creators' synthesis of the Earthen has been chronicled and stored here for this world in the Discs of Norgannon.""You have uncovered a wealth of previously undiscovered worldly lore!"
2279,"Touching the Discs of Norgannon once again makes your hand tingle.  This time, however, a strange grinding noise is heard from inside the discs.Your backpack suddenly becomes heavier than it was before.  Inside, you discover a miniature version of the discs!No doubt, an item of this sort would be invaluable for someone interested in the ancient history of Azeroth.  The Explorers' League in Ironforge is such a group, known throughout the Alliance; perhaps they can make good use of it."
2280,"Touching the Discs of Norgannon once again makes your hand tingle.  This time, however, a strange grinding noise is heard from inside the discs.Your backpack suddenly becomes heavier than it was before.  Inside, you discover a miniature version of the discs!No doubt, an item of this sort would be invaluable for someone interested in the ancient history of Azeroth.  The sages of Thunder Bluff are such historians, known throughout the Horde; perhaps they can make good use of it."
2281,"Sending you out in the field now would be suicide. Renzik doesn't need another dead rogue on his hands. Don't fret, though, <name> - Renzik is going to get you up to speed.Make your way to the Redridge Mountains and speak with an associate of SI:7 named Lucius. You will find him hanging around the docks of Lakeshire with the other shady good-for-nothings."
2282,"We've been training thieves here for years! After all, not every rapscallion is born with the grace and finesse of old Lucius.Up off the road here you'll find Alther's Mill. I got a chest up there with something important inside. Go get it for me! Bring back that token and you'll receive your Certificate of Thievery!"
2283,"We've got work for you, that is if you've got the guts to do it!Deep in the Badlands is the Uldaman dig site.  We've heard a tale about some idiot paladin who died there recently.  Why we even care is that he had a very valuable necklace on him.  It's supposedly got three large gems: a ruby, a sapphire, and a topaz.The shot: we want it, and we're payin' TOP SILVER to get it.  It may be damaged, but that's neither here nor there; we'll fix whatever scratches are on it."
2284,"As sure as Malton is a dummy, those gems are still in Uldaman somewhere.  You're going to have to go back there and look for them.Like I said before, if the information we have is correct then there's a ruby, a sapphire, and a topaz that go with the necklace.  Find them and put them in the necklace.As to where the gems are, who knows?  Maybe you'll get lucky and find the corpse of the Paladin.  If he's not been stripped clean already, then maybe he's got them on him still."
2298,"So there we were, about to start plottin' out phase III when a couple o' Magni's blockheads come bargin' in here talkin' bout some kind o' heist and arresting some o' the Hidden Circle.Well nobody puts the iron on old Blackbeard! The argumentations got heavy and thick and somehow yer name weres blurted out!Me advice? Take the first Gryphon out o' Ironforge and get to Stormwind. Get yerself to Old Town and once there, talk to an old friend o' mine named Renzik ""The Shiv."""
2299,"Where have you been, <name>? Hulfdan's been looking all over the place for you. We thought the king may have put you in irons.Get to Ironforge as soon as possible and speak with Hulfdan!"
2300,"Renzik was looking for you, fish.I wouldn't keep Mathias's second in command waiting if I were you."
2318,"At an impasse of sorts, you know that you will need the book translated into a language you can understand.  There certainly are a number of people in the world who could do it; the closest location that might have someone who could, however, is the Kargath outpost in the Badlands.  Perhaps that is a good place to start."
2338,"Droffers and Son Salvage aren't smart enough to restore the magic in the necklace, but I am.  All I want to do is study the necklace so I can learn to make them myself.  To do that, I will need your necklace.  Let me borrow it, and in exchange for the time I get to study it I will translate the journal for you.  While you are searching for the gems, I should have enough time to learn what I need to.It's a simple deal, and no one else will be the wiser.  Whatcha wanna do?"
2339,"Here is the journal, translated for you to read on your own.  The crux of it says dwarves hid the ruby, the troggs hid the topaz, and a trogg named Grimlok has the sapphire.Look - you're going to need a power source to make the necklace work again.  Dran Droffers doesn't know this.  To find one, here's what I'd do: go as deep as you can in Uldaman and kill whatever construct there is the strongest.  No doubt whatever that is would have it.When you have everything collected, come back here!"
2340,"Any necklace setting and gem will work, so long as they are the same material.  This power source, however, is what will bring the magic back to the necklace... I hope.I'll gladly supply the gems needed for your version of the necklace, so long as the power source actually works.Head to Orgrimmar and keep your end of the bargain with Droffers and Son Salvage.  Just keep your mouth shut about our deal, and when you get back I might have a wonderful surprise for you."
2341,"As Dran and Malton Droffers begin to squabble over their new salvage, half of the deal is now complete.  A trip to the Badlands is now in order to finish things up, as Jarkal Mossmeld in Kargath might have a special reward waiting for you there."
2342,"Sweeping the bat pens with this broom is not befitting a Garrett!  I've earned a little coin from this accursed job, and I'm willing to spend it on you to better my station.The Garrett family weapon of choice is locked away in our chest in the South Common Hall of Uldaman from when we Garretts toiled there as diggers.  Without it, I will be stuck here forever - literally - sweeping up after these infernal bats.Reclaim my family's treasure and bring it to me!  Help me restore my birthright!"
2358,"Many years ago, the Horns of Nez'ra were stolen from Ravenholdt manor. Across continents and oceans I have searched, only to discover that these insignificant beasts have had it in their possession all along.Slay every Blackrock orc you cross until the Horns of Nez'ra are recovered. Should you recover the horns, find me in Lakeshire.Do this for me and your name shall be known to Ravenholdt, <name>."
2359,"I've been staking out this tower for weeks, <name>. Recently a major shipment came through from Duskwood, and along with it came those guards.What are they? Your guess is as good as mine. I can tell you one thing - they aren't human.Anyhow, the shipment had a chest - which is what I assume those abominations are guarding. The zombie with the spikes holds a key we'll need.Get that key, get in the tower, and uncover whatever is in that chest. Take your findings back to Mathias."
2360,"Not a moment too soon, <name>. SI:7 reconnaissance is reporting unusually heavy Defias activity in Westfall.It would seem that the Defias have taken over an abandoned Alliance watch tower southeast of Sentinel Hill and are using it as a base of operations to smuggle in goods from the Redridge supply route.Get to Westfall and contact Agent Kearnen for your debriefing. You will find her hidden near the tower....and <name>, should you be discovered, SI:7 will disavow all knowledge of your existence."
2378,"You have served the Deathstalkers well, <name>, but perhaps it is time for you to venture outward. While you have shown aptitude in the ways of stealth and deception, you still require much training.The Deathstalkers have allies within the Shattered Hand. Seek out those that would assist us - find Shenthul in Orgrimmar."
2379,Your determination alone is not enough to overcome the obstacles that lay ahead of us.Speak with Zando'zan to begin your training as an operative of the Shattered Hand.It is only when you have mastered the practices of stealth and thievery that you may take the next step towards your destiny.
2380,"A master of stealth and deception you are not, however, all of that can and will change. You've obviously impressed those in charge with your meager skills, as the great Shenthul has asked for you by name.Take the road north of here to Orgrimmar and speak with Shenthul in the Cleft of Shadow."
2381,"I don't mean to scare you, <name>, but the last five thieves I sent to steal the southsea treasure came back to me in pieces.South along the coast you'll find Tide Razor, the southsea freebooter's ship. Nestled in the hold is the payoff - the southsea treasure. On the second level of that ship is the pirate's den, a place where they train all of their thieves.Board that ship, steal the treasure, and bring it back to me. Use the pirate's den if you need to practice your thievery, but be careful!"
2382,"Zando'zan has seen it! Yes, the day comes! Thrall's death... the dagger in his back, poison seeping through to his every vein... Zando'zan has said too much.<name>! Zando'zan has a task for <name>! <name> must travel to Ratchet, east of the Crossroads, and speak with Wrenix the Wretched. Go!"
2383,"Ah, while you were gone a parchment came for you, <name>.Read it when you have time. If I'm not mistaken, it came from the warrior trainer Frang. He would have words with you when you're ready. You'll find him outside the Den, taking cover in the shade."
2398,"The dig site at Uldaman wasn't always overrun.  We Ironforge dwarves used to control the area, but... that was before the troggs came.  They came so fast and in such numbers that not even dwarven might could stop them!In fact, their attack was so sudden that I fear some of our people may be trapped behind enemy lines.My friend Baelog led a small band of dwarves deep within the site just before the troggs showed up.  If he and his company live, then I want you to find them."
2418,"A while ago, I had an incident with the Shadowforge Dwarves.  They brought me to Angor Fortress to study two types of strange stones from Uldaman.  I discovered that the stones were sustained, stable power sources if treated correctly.  It's amazing the things one can find in that old dig site!Anyway, after I told them the secret of the stones they kicked me out of Angor Fortress and began digging for more in Uldaman.I want those stones for myself!  Bring me both types and I'll pay you plenty!"
2438,"I was once given an emerald dreamcatcher from Gaerolas Talvethen, the warden of the druids in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. This powerful amulet is able to siphon energy from the Emerald Dream, bestowing luck upon those who carry it.Sadly, I have not been able to retrieve it from my dresser in Starbreeze Village... Although Starbreeze was once a tranquil place, it has now succumbed to the corruption of the furbolg that reside there.Perhaps you would be willing to recover my dreamcatcher, <class>?"
2439,"This object is an incredible find.  The ancient Titans, or the Creators as these discs refer to them as, are the link to our enchanted creation, if the lore stored in here is correct!  We'll need to invest as much research time into this as possible.As for you, heroic <class>, take this voucher to Dinita Stonemantle at the vault.  It grants you what I think is a fitting for such a tremendous find!Return to me directly when you are ready; there is much more to do for the Explorers' League!"
2440,"I shall focus my energies on these discs; they will reveal their true workings to me in due time.As for you <name>, I will now reward you for your diligence in bringing this to my attention.  Take this voucher to Bena Winterhoof, the alchemy trainer for Thunder Bluff.  She will give you a special item I believe you will find appealing, and she will supply you with a choice of potions from my personal stock.Return to me soon, as I sense there is much more at hand for us to do regarding this find."
2458,"The Venture Company... Perhaps you have heard of them?For one year we have worked on planting an agent deep within their ranks. Through much hard work and careful planning, we succeeded.Recently we received word that the Venture Co. are planning something on a grand scale. Go north of the Sludge Fen to the Venture Co. tower and contact our undercover agent, Taskmaster Fizzule.When you find the tower, use this flare gun, then approach Fizzule and show him the salute of the Shattered Hand."
2459,"The emerald... It is missing! My dreamcatcher has been damaged!There is a band of Gnarlpine mystics located to the north of Starbreeze. I have heard reports that their leader, Ferocitas the Dream Eater has been wearing a necklace that glows green in the night. Now seeing my dreamcatcher, I am sure that he has stolen my emerald... He would never realize that its power is useless to him.Find this missing jewel, <name>. And, while you're there, clear out some of the corrupted mystics as well."
2460,"As a rogue of the Shattered Hand, it is imperative that you learn the Shattered Salute. It is the only way to truly identify another member of the Hand.Watch, learn, repeat."
2478,"You will need to steal the tower key from Foreman Silixiz, <name>. Once you've got the key in your possession, hold on to it - I may need it later.Remember, the poison has weakened everything in this tower. Use your abilities to bring chaos and destruction to its inhabitants. Slay them all -- show no mercy!Once everything inside lays in a bloodied heap, pick Gallywix's lockbox and steal the cache of Zanzil's mixture held inside. Take both the head of Gallywix and the mixture to Shenthul in Orgrimmar."
2479,"Take a sample of the mixture to Serge Hinott in Tarren Mill.If anyone can cure you, it's Serge. Live long enough and Serge will show you the ways of poison creation and use."
2480,"I have never seen such wondrous results from a poison! Zanzil you say? Never heard of him, however, I must commend him on the creation of this concoction.So, I am to cure you of this and then teach you how to make use of the poison?Give me a few moments to examine the toxin, <name>."
2498,"I have just received word that  Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth has discovered what may be the cause of the tumors that plague the timberlings. Please speak with him, and tell him I sent you.Make haste, <name>; he needs our help."
2499,"In a cave along the southern bank of the lake, a timberling named Oakenscowl is spreading corruption to all the creatures that make Lake Al'Ameth their home.I dared not get too close, but even from a distance, it is obvious: Oakenscowl is being poisoned by the largest tumor I have ever seen...  I would call it gargantuan, even.<name>, you have already done much to aid my efforts, but I ask of you one more task. Hunt down Oakenscowl and collect the tumor; remove this source of corruption from my home."
2500,"<class>, I would make use of your services.  I am an alchemist of some note, and I seek your aid in acquiring some reagents found out in the Badlands.I need the following items to replenish my stocks: five buzzard gizzards, ten crag coyote fangs, and five rock elemental shards.  Obviously, you can get them off of the beasties themselves; if you're not the fighting type, then find friends who are.Acquire these items for me, you'll get some coin out of the deal.Well, what say ye?"
2501,"You have been most helpful to me, <name>.  I would like to reward you with the very recipe for the brew I gave you earlier, but I must ask of you a favor that is quite dangerous.This lockbox contains three empty thaumaturgy vessels; they are imbued with an attunement aura that will drain the blood of a scorched guardian dragon.  Using one on the beast will anger it greatly, so be careful.  Once you have all three filled, bring them to me.Do this, and the recipe will be yours."
2518,"Lady Sathrah was once beloved of Elune. Graceful and pure, the spider spun her silver threads through the moonlight, catching the evening mist. The silvery dew had strong healing powers and was kept here in the temple.But of late, Sathrah has descended into madness. Her future generations are now threatened as well.Find Lady Sathrah, <name>, and end her suffering. She dwells along the northern borders of Teldrassil, near Wellspring Lake. Gather her silvery spinnerets and bring them back to me."
2519,"A once great creature of the forest is in need of help, <race>.There is a difficult task that must be done.Please seek out Priestess A'moora; she will explain things to you. Find her to the southeast of here, inside the Temple of the Moon."
2520,"Now you must finish the task to which you have been appointed. Take the spinnerets and offer Lady Sathrah's sacrifice to Elune; lay the great spider to rest.Inside this temple, find the central fountain. There is where you may leave the sacrifice.  The holy waters will purify and cleanse the corruption that drove Sathrah mad.When you have completed this, return to me."
2521,"<race>, can your miniscule brain comprehend the rarity of a flawless sphere of draenethyst? Draenei have spent lifetimes in search of just one of these crystals, only to meet horrible fates, their purpose unfulfilled.So you stand before Kum'isha, knowing what Kum'isha has requested and still wish to assist? Very well, <race>... At any time during your travels across these lands, should you find a flawless sphere of draenethyst, return it to me and I shall reward you with riches beyond your wildest dreams."
2522,"Even though the portal conjuration was a failure, I remain hopeful that my next attempt will be successful.The hope of the Draenei is as fervent as your greed for trinkets, <race>. Go back out into these cursed lands and recover another flawless draenethyst sphere.Of course, the choice to take on this task is completely left to you *grin*."
2541,"The Gnarlpine shaman that inhabit this place have discovered a way of separating a sleeping druid's spirit from the physical body. The furbolg have animated my physical form and are using it to attack anyone that attempts to explore the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. I am now trapped in the Emerald Dream, powerless to stop this.You must help me. The Gnarlpine shaman carry a strange charm which is used to perform this ritual, and I'd like to examine it. Please, <name>, bring one to me."
2561,"After examining this charm, <name>, I see now what must be done. Please take it, and do as I ask.You are to explore the deepest areas of the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. There, you will find my soulless body... Although I regret what I am about to tell you, I see no other way to free myself from the control of the Gnarlpine.In order for me to escape them, you must kill my physical form.  Once that is done, use the voodoo charm on my fallen body. After you have completed this task, please return to me."
2581,"It is a well known fact that hyenas possess tremendous strength in their jowls, but the strength to snap through three inches of thorium steel? Impossible, improbable, and yet I have seen this demonstrated with my own eyes.Venture forth, into the Blasted Lands, and bring me three snickerfang jowls. As you search for the snickerfang, be on the lookout for boars and scorpoks: The initial assay also requires two blasted boar lungs and one scorpok pincer to complete."
2582,"Ah, <name>, welcome back. It seems you enjoyed the effect of the robust, operational imbue, derived from snickerfang. Be warned, while the immediate effect is a titanic burst of strength, the long term effects on your spirit and intelligence could be hazardous.With that said, do you require more? If so, bring me another three snickerfang jowls, two blasted boar lungs, and one scorpok pincer."
2583,"Within these blasted lands exists two species of boar: the ash-mane boar and the helboar.It would appear that the stamina of these beasts renders them nearly immune to harm, as the other animals find them too difficult to kill and consequently, not worth the effort.We need to perform further analysis, <name>. Should you bring me three blasted boar lungs, two scorpok pincers, and one basilisk brain, I shall create a divine elixir from the residue of the assay. You will be my first test subject!"
2584,"When I first administered the elixir, <name>, I could tell that one or two applications would not satiate your appetite. Even now, I can see the hunger in your eyes. The concoction has addictive properties of which, seemingly, the most strong of will cannot resist.So be it! Should you require more of the lung juice cocktail, venture back into the wasteland and find for me three blasted boar lungs, two scorpok pincers, and one basilisk brain."
2585,"Have you ever watched them in battle, <name>? The scorpoks, I mean. Have you ever seen the grace and agility with which they move? The decisiveness of their strikes?If only we could somehow isolate that agility and encapsulate it, we would be wealthy beyond our... I mean... it would be a boon for the scientific community.Assist me, <name>, and I shall allow you a sampling of the assay.In order to create a stable sample, I will need three scorpok pincers, two vulture gizzards, and one blasted boar lung."
2586,"You live! This is good news, indeed. I assume you are back for more of the scorpok assay?Very well, <name>, back to the wasteland with you and do not return until you have collected three scorpok pincers, two vulture gizzards, and one blasted boar lung."
2601,"These wastelands are riddled with redstone basilisk, <name>. These basilisk have adapted and flourished, more so than any of the other wildlife within the region.I have watched from afar as they hunt and go about their daily activities - the beasts exhibit a thought process more complex than even some humanoids.I must study their brains!Retrieve ten of their brains for me, <name>. The compound cannot be complete, however, without two vulture gizzards to form the base of the solution."
2602,"Your focused concentration has dwindled so soon? More research must be done!Oh yes, the price remains the same, <name>. Venture forth into the blasted lands and return to me with ten brains from the redstone and two vulture gizzards."
2603,"Death does indeed have wings in these blasted lands, <race>. I have witnessed the black slayers and bonepickers feasting upon the corpse of many a fallen explorer - sometimes feeding upon the most vile and disease ridden of carcasses. It is a wonder, then, how their internal systems overcome the pestilence that claims these lands.Assist me in my studies, <name>! Gizzards I need! Two snickerfang jowls will also be required for the base of the concoction.You shall be rewarded two-fold for your efforts."
2604,"I see that the inner fire has dwindled. Would you say the spiritual euphoria lasted an hour?If it's more of the gizzard gum you desire, then more of the gizzards I require. Back to the wastelands, <name>. Do not return until you have recovered ten gizzards and two jowls."
2605,"I've got an idea, see. I've heard of some strange creatures called dew collectors that live to the southwest... and that they are able to store water in special glands.I think that if I could get one of these glands, I could create a drink that would quench my terrible thirst! Do you think you could help me, <name>?Look for the cactus garden, <name>; that's where you'll find the dew collectors."
2606,"Blech! This stuff tastes terrible! So much for that idea...Wait, what's that? Oh, I know, I know, you think I shouldn't give up on this stuff. Well, okay then.Uhhhh, I have an idea! Brilliant! Take this dew to my friend Sprinkle -- she's an excellent chef. Tell her what we're up to here and that we want to make it go down a little easier.I mean, if it's going to taste that bad, it at least should have some kick to it... And I'm just not feeling it..."
2607,"It appears as if you've brought back more information than even I expected. This certainly is a strange turn of events, <name>.A cure? Hrm... Go down to the cellar and speak with Doc Mixilpixil - he may be able to help."
2608,"Oh my, you look like death. Correction - I've seen death, you look worse than death. You, < sir/miss>, would be what death coughed up at his last physical.Hah! You hear that Noarm? Write that one down!*Cough* Hrm yes, in order for me to help you, I'll need to draw some blood. Don't worry, it only hurts the first few... fifty times or so... /lay down when you're ready for the treatment, <name>."
2609,"It's unanimous, <name>. You've got the 'itis.'Luckily, I have a cure for the 'itis.'Here's what I need: One bundle of simple wildflowers, one leaded vial, one bronze tube, and last but certainly not least, one spool of light chartreuse silk thread. Ol' Emma left a spool of it for me at 'The Finest Thread.' You can find the shop along the canals.Hurry along now, <name>, and try not to touch anyone until you're cured. Oh, and Dr. Montgomery says you need a shower -- his words, not mine."
2621,"Regret. It is all I have now. One bad decision resulting in several horrible outcomes. If only I had waited for those orders. Maybe they would have detailed the horrors that awaited us in those cursed lands! Maybe they were to redirect us to another detail? Ultimately, it was my fault. All of it was my fault.So here I stand, awaiting orders. I must know. I must have those orders.Dispatch Commander Ruag resides in Stonard. Find him and find out what became of the orders."
2622,"The orders? What could you possibly want with the orders?What are you implying, <name>? Of course I relayed those orders! The soldiers I sent the orders with were ambushed and brutally beaten by murlocs. Only one survived, if you can call that surviving. He can hardly speak, cannot walk, and must be fed through a tube. If you want to know what happened to those orders, speak with Bengor. I'm sure he is around here somewhere... and, <name>, be mindful of what you stick your nose into - it may get bitten off."
2623,"Orders were given by the dispatch commander. We took... took orders. On way to Blasted Lands, ambushed.Murlocs... Many murlocs... One named Swamp Talker. Took orders from my hands as spear thrust into my skull. East... cave....<Bengor passes out.>"
2641,"When I was a kid, my sister used to do all the cooking. It was horrible! I could barely stomach some of her concoctions -- until I found what I like to call my ""secret"" ingredient! Add it to anything, and... WOW! It tastes great!What is it, you ask? It's a mushroom called the Violet Tragan. If you want me to help you turn this horrid-tasting brew into something edible, head to the Hinterlands, and look for a small lake there.Oh, and remember, the Violet Tragan can only be found underwater."
2661,"Here's the Violet Powder, <name>. Take it to Marin and tell him he owes me a favor!"
2662,"Now, to mix this powder in with the dew.Come back and talk to me in a minute... after I have perfected the fabulous Noggenfogger Elixir!"
2681,"It will take more than you alone to overcome the forces of Razelikh and his subordinates.Gather a suitable group of adventurers and free my men of their eternal torture! Eighteen stones you must shatter.Fight hard and die with honor, <name>."
2701,"Please, take from this a relic of old. We no longer have a use for the item.May it serve you well in your fight against the legion."
2702,"You have honored me with your nobility and heroism, <name>.You have also honored them..."
2721,"As one chapter of your adventure closes, another one begins, <name>.One of my men is still unaccounted for, lost somewhere in the Blasted Lands. I am talking about Lieutenant Kirith, of course.As I had mentioned earlier, we were both imprisoned and tortured by Allistarj, but poor Kirith, his strength of will faltered. I could hear the experiments from my cage; the tortured screams rang through the halls of the cave. That was the last I saw or heard of Kirith."
2742,"Hey <race>!Rin'ji lost axe and was captured! Please, help Rin'ji escape. Me know that <race> like you don't like Rin'ji's kind, but Rin'ji begs! Must get out of here!Got something for nice <race> if <he helps Rin'ji out of here/she helps Rin'ji out of here>...Rin'ji is hiding something secret at the Overlook Cliffs."
2743,"Let us not mince words, <race>; my time here is limited.You must destroy the triad of power which protects the demon lord, Razelikh. Doing so will not be as simple a task as freeing a damned soul.<Kirith grins.>You see, each of Razelikh's underlings wears a third of an amulet of Razelikh's creation around their neck. The very same amulet you will need in order to summon the arch demon.Return to Trebor and tell him what is required to summon Razelikh. He will be able to instruct you further."
2744,"The triad is protected by Razelikh.In exchange for their servitude, Razelikh granted each of them nearly unlimited power within the Blasted Lands. The amulet pieces are each attuned to the lifeforce of their owner, granting them immortality. As long as they remain within the Blasted Lands, they cannot be slain, their life spans extended until the end of days.There is one who may be able to assist you further, <name>. Travel to Azshara and find the demon hunter, Loramus Thalipedes. Search the islands."
2745,"Hmm, an interesting tale, and not one to be taken lightly. Yeah, I can help you, but what you need to do is divvy out a form of justice that's not... legal, if you're to see this through to the end.Lescovar and Marzon need to be dealt with, and swiftly. Do you think you're capable of such a thing?You decide. If so, then make haste to the castle and find an old friend of mine, a gnome named Tyrion. He's been watching Lescovar now for a couple weeks. He should be able to help you end this."
2746,"Trias wants the timetable pushed up some, huh? Okay, we can do that, but I'm not ready. And know this, I'm doing the hard part, but you're the one that's going to get < his/her> hands dirty, understand? Good.Okay, I'll need you to get me a few things before I can put my plan into effect. I got the perfect disguise that'll get Spybot past those guards.Bring me some silk and a couple apples. The silk's up to you, but Clara's little farm right outside the city has the perfect sized apples."
2751,"Twenty generations of Omosh have held this hammer, <name>. A hundred thousand tons of metal we have molded. Tragically, it all ends at Orokk, failure of the Omosh: Without kin and incapable of producing offspring.I cannot let the secret recipes of Omosh die with me! Someone must continue the legacy, Omosh or not!Prove to Orokk you are capable, <name>. Bring for Orokk the following: Two patterned bronze bracers, two bronze greatswords, and two sharp claws. Bring them for Orokk and we shall continue."
2752,"Orokk sees the eagerness in your eyes, <name>. Like a sponge you soak in the wisdom of the Omosh.Three lessons I shall teach!Return to the anvil, soak in the heat of the forge, create for Orokk four bronze battleaxes and four bronze warhammers. Only then will you learn of the iron pauldron."
2753,"Only two more lessons Orokk will teach, <name>. Your muscles ache, I know, but continue on for the Omosh!Bring to Orokk four green iron helms, four green iron bracers, and two green iron leggings - for this you learn and your enemies suffer!"
2754,"The final lesson Orokk teaches you, <name>. To the sacred anvil and forge you return! Bring for Orokk two solid iron mauls, two silvered bronze boots, and two silvered bronze gauntlets.See the fear in their eyes as you approach!"
2755,"Orokk is not crying, <name>. Soot is in eye.<Orokk wipes a tear away.>There is one last Omosh family secret Orokk will teach you. Orokk will die happy, thanks to <name>.Learn Omosh dance of joy and then you learn fist of iron!"
2756,"In the time of legends, Aturk would crush the skulls of his enemies and grind the bone into a fine powder for use in filament. Long gone are those days, <race>. The Warchief calls for peace among the clans. Old enemies are now only watched with weary eyes!Unbelievable, I know, but such is the will of Thrall.Enough lamenting! You are here to learn, and learn you will! Bring me four steel breastplates and four steel helms and you will gain a taste of war!"
2757,"Listen, kid, you're not gonna learn anything hanging around here.I know a guy who knows a guy. He hangs around the smithy in Booty Bay. If you show him this insignia, he'll tell you all about mithril.So whadd'ya say? Leave this kid stuff to the babies in diapers, <name> -- it's time to move on.If you're interested, his name's McGavan. Show him this trinket and he'll recognize your commitment."
2758,"When I was about your age, a dwarf by the name of Galvan took me under his wing and trained me in the ways of the armorsmith. Before he left for Booty Bay, he made me promise to train all those with the desire and determination to advance in the craft of blacksmithing -- so here I am -- all these years later.So, now it's time for you to learn a little something. Make me six golden scale bracers and you will learn where smithing comes from, <name>."
2759,"Although Galvan left Booty Bay many years ago, members of the order still remain in town, hoping to one day find another worthy of Galvan's tutelage.Take this insignia and present it to McGavan in Booty Bay.If you actually make it that far, he'll know that you are worthy. I have faith, <name>!"
2760,"Most of our recruits never make it to Booty Bay, <name>. The shine of the insignia is enough to trigger the loot lust in even the staunchest of blacksmiths. Fools they be, as the insignia is a drop in the bucket compared to the wealth of items you'll see!Find Galvan the Ancient and show him this pin. His residence is far to the north, between Zul Gurub and the Mosh'Ogg ogre mound."
2761,"Many blacksmiths believe that mining and smithing are separate, independent jobs; but can there be blacksmithing without mining? Ah ha -- it is an impossibility! The accomplished blacksmith must also be an accomplished miner.Show Galvan that you are capable, <name>. Bring me forty bars of iron and forty bars of mithril. For this, Galvan will teach you the ways of the ornate mithril pants!"
2762,"It is said that truesilver is stronger and more durable than mithril. Galvan does not disagree with this assessment of the minerals, but contrary to its name, truesilver is not true! Mithril is a far nobler mineral! HAH! Regardless, for this lesson you will need to find the great silver deceiver, <name>.Bring me forty bars of mithril and five bars of truesilver. In exchange, you will be taught the secret of ornate mithril gloves and more importantly, learn that truesilver is a liar!"
2763,"The harvesting of precious gems is of utmost importance to our craft, <name>. Few gems are more precious than the citrine. The magical properties we imbue into our goods are amplified greatly by the presence of citrine.For this lesson, we will fortify forty bars of mithril with four citrines. The result will be a better understanding of magical gemology and the knowledge to create ornate mithril shoulders."
2764,"If you are ready to conclude your training with Galvan, you should journey to Gadgetzan.There, you will find my finest pupil: Trenton Lighthammer. He has much to teach you in the ways of ornate mithril. Otherwise, remain here and learn!Oh, Gadgetzan is in Tanaris, of course!"
2765,"When you first came to me, I knew that you would turn out to be one of my finest pupils! It was without hesitancy that you gave up a trinket of some power to McGavan. You did this only so that you could meet me. Such blind faith and devotion to the craft should be rewarded.You have attained expertise over blacksmithing, <name>. Reap the rewards!"
2766,"You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.""My name's Oglethorpe Obnoticus, and my homing robot has crashed!  I will reward you for its recovery; please take this beacon to the robot!""""I now have computed the coordinates of the robot for you; it is in a cave near Feral Scar Vale!"""
2767,"The gnome's voice crackles once again from the robot:""I need to move OOX-22/FE to an open, safe place so it can begin a lengthy take-off procedure.  It has built-in cloaking, but I need time on my end to make it operational again.  Escort the robot from its current location to, let's say, the dock along the Forgotten Coast!  That should be a perfect place, and long enough, to get things online!""""Escort it safely to the dock, and then come talk to me in Booty Bay!  Oglethorpe Obnoticus - out!"""
2768,"Sergeant Bly stole from me!  He said he'd only borrow it, but he stole my cherished divino-matic rod!!  Without that rod how will I know where to dig new water holes??Find Bly and bring me my rod!  I heard he led his band of ill-reputed adventurers to go treasure hunting in Zul'Farrak to the west.  I bet you'll find him there.Let's hope the trolls took care of him, because if you have to fight him for the rod then you're in for a serious fight."
2769,"Have you met the Brassbolts brothers?  They're over in the Shimmering Flats, in Kalimdor, racing their rocket car against the goblins.  They usually win which is no surprise--the goblin car blows up so much it barely ever crosses the finish line!But even then, the Brassbolts brothers are always looking for new ways to make their car go faster, and Wizzle told me he needs a very rare component for his next experiment.He probably needs help getting that part.  Speak to him and find out."
2770,"Deep in Zul'Farrak, the sand troll city in Tanaris, there is a sacred pool.  From that pool the trolls summon a huge beast!  Gahz'rilla!  He's so fierce that even his scales crackle with energy.  It's that energy I want to harness for my car!Bring me the electrified scale of Gahz'rilla!But the summoning of Gahz'rilla is a well-kept secret of the trolls.  To face him, you must first wrest the secret from them."
2771,"It seems as if master had this planned from the start. I was not taught to create the items which you learned to create and you were not taught the items which I learned to create.The master is wise, <name>. We shall teach each other!Show me how to make a mithril coif and ornate mithril shoulders and I shall show you how to create an ornate mithril helm."
2772,"At last year's All-Valley Blacksmithing Championship, all those who watched saw my leg get swept from under me by a cowardly dog from the Venture Co. Foundry. What they didn't know, however, was the reason I was able to continue and ultimately win the tournament: That's right, ornate mithril boots!I will need to learn how to craft ornate mithril pants for this year's tournament, however, as a Venture Co. shredder is an entrant! Teach me the way of the pants and learn the way of the boot!"
2773,"Around these parts I am known as the Mithril Kid. I supply ornate mithril to adventurers from around the world.<Trenton whispers.>Little do they know that I do not know the technique to fashion ornate mithril gloves. Shhhh! This will be our little secret.Teach me the technique to create ornate mithril gloves, <name>, and in exchange, I will show you the resultant of the culmination of my training under Galvan: the ornate mithril breastplate."
2781,"WANTED: Caliph Scorpidsting!The Gadgetzan Water Company of Gadgetzan, Tanaris will pay a high bounty for the head of Caliph Scorpidsting, leader of the Wastewander outlaws.  His crimes include:1.  Murdering Gadgetzan Water Co. employees!2.Stealing Gadgetzan Water Co. resources!3.Seizing Gadgetzan Water Co. property!Bring proof of Caliph Scorpidsting's demise to Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle for an immediate reward!"
2782,"The tablet is covered with Witherbark troll markings. Rin'ji's secret truly is a mystery...It's possible that you might have something quite valuable on your hands here. On the other hand, quite the opposite is also possible. A Witherbark troll in distress would probably do anything to find his way out of trouble..."
2783,"We fight the wrong enemy, <name>.The true power in these lands continues to grow in strength and number while we squabble over scorched earth with orcs.Do we continue to fight a war in these lands against the Horde, only to be routed one day by the armies of the Burning Legion? It is futile.Put your differences aside, <name>, speak with the fallen hero of the Horde. He knows the truth behind the Blasted Lands."
2784,"Hear my story, <race>."
2801,"Before we may continue, you must hear my story."
2821,"My philosophy on leatherworking is that the work must be the best quality possible - no compromises.  Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter is trying to sell you ocean-front property in Dun Morogh!In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have run across thick yeti hides.  The Yeti are native to Feralas, with many found in Feral Scar Vale.  I want some, and I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.  If that sounds fair to you, then we're in business."
2822,"I take pride in my leather work, and I feel it shows; quality should never be compromised.  Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter would also have you believe that the earth does not keep secrets!In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have discovered thick yeti hides.  Yetis are native to Feralas, often found west of here in Feral Scar Vale.  I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.  If that is agreeable to you, then we are set!"
2841,"Gnome technology - two years ago its most common use was as a punch line. Times certainly have changed. Now they've got a new rig built that's better than all our shredder models combined. I need the blueprints, <name>!Unfortunately, the plans are locked away in a safe near Mekgineer Thermaplugg. To make matters worse, the combination to the safe is only known by Mekgineer Thermaplugg.Do whatever you have to do to get that combination, <name>. Then crack open that safe and bring back those blueprints!"
2842,"As soon as we got word from Kernobee about the new gnomish rig, Scooty and I began work on the Transpolyporter 6000: The fastest and most reliable way to Gnomeregan.It's finally ready for passengers to board, <name>. If you want to give it a try, go to Booty Bay and talk with Scooty at the wind rider roost. To get to Booty Bay, take the boat from Ratchet.Of course, you could always try and make the run to Gnomeregan through the dwarf infested mountains of Dun Morogh!"
2843,"As long as you have the transponder in your possession, all you need to do is step on the pad and you'll be teleported to Gnomeregan.You may experience some unusual side effects, but none of those should be permanent... anymore.I almost forgot the most important part - getting back. When you're ready to come back, just step on the transpolyporter pad in Gnomeregan!Now to calibrate the transponder to your size and weight."
2844,"I am no good, <name>. I was 'spose to be watchin' over my little friend, Shay, and somehow, she got away from me. I'm not all that sure what happened, really, but last time I saw her, we was walkin' through the ruins just north of here.Everythin' was goin' fine, but then I turned around, and... she was gone.Now I jus can't quite figure out what I should do here. Got any ideas, <name>? I'm awful worried.Hey, how 'bout you go look fer Shay? Yer legs can travel much faster 'n mine."
2845,"Do you think you could help me find my way back to my friend, Rockbiter? He was supposed to be watching me... But I do have a tendency to wander off now and then. There are just so many things to see, and I get so distracted.There is one thing that will always work to get my attention, though.Inside this chest, you'll find a bell that is very precious to me. I just love the sound of it. You have my word, if I wander off, all you have to do is ring it and I'll come running back."
2846,"Long ago I possessed a beautiful piece of jewelry, the Tiara of the Deep.  And not only was it pretty--it held great power for those with the knowledge to use it.So when word of the tiara reached the Hydromancer Velratha, she had to have it.  She sent agents to my home and they stole it while I was away.  The thieves!I want my tiara back!  Go to Zul'Farrak, the troll city in Tanaris, find Velratha and wrench the tiara from her.  Return it to me and you'll earn my favor."
2847,"<name>, you're becoming quite skilled as a leatherworker!  I know some patterns you might be interested in... Wild Leather armor!  Wild Leather taps into the potent and chaotic properties of wildvines, found in areas of lush vegetation and on some of the creatures there.  The armor made using it is second to none for people of your skill, guaranteed.I'll teach this to you, but you'll be working for me for a while.  The first cost is simply ten pieces of thick leather.  After this, we'll talk specifics."
2848,"Wild Leather shoulders support the wearer's frame extremely well, offering top notch protection of the upper arms and the shoulders themselves.  As with all Wild Leather armor, a potent but random benefit is applied to the item as the wildvine is stitched in.For this pattern, I will require six thick armor kits and a wildvine.  That shouldn't be too tall of an order for you to fill."
2849,"Wild Leather vests are the staple of any Wild Leather armor set.  The frame of the vest blends with the wildvine to produce a product that offers maximum protection of the torso while allowing for the potent magic to work its way through the garment.For this pattern, I will require two Turtle Scale breastplates, two sets of Turtle Scale gloves, and a wildvine.  It's a tall order, but one you should have little difficulty in filling for me."
2850,"A Wild Leather helmet offers the wearer superior protection to the vital areas of the head without a sacrifice in comfort.  As with all Wild Leather armor, the integrated wildvine yields a powerful but random enhancement to the frame of the helm.  Leather wearers will definitely want this piece!For this pattern, I will need two Nightscape tunics, two Nightscape headbands, and a wildvine.  Complete this order and the pattern will be yours!"
2851,"You've learned quite a bit now, <name>; still, there is more for you to learn.  Next are Wild Leather boots, the cornerstone of any set.These boots are crafted to cradle the foot in comfort while bracing it against the hazards of adventuring.  The soft soles are a blessing to those seeking quiet movement in footwear.For this pattern, I need an order of two Nightscape pants and two Nightscape boots filled.  I also will require two wildvines... not just one.  When you have all this, let me know."
2852,"With the basics down, you are ready to master more complex fare, <name>.  Wild Leather leggings are some of the sturdiest and powerful leather gear around.  The waist, thighs, calves, and the vitals - all are given tremendous protection.  Coupled with the enhancement that the wildvine provides, adventurers who own it will thank you each time they see you.For this pattern, I need an order of two Turtle Scale helms, two Turtle Scale bracers, and two wildvines filled."
2853,"Well <name>, you are the definition of diligence.  There is one pattern left for Wild Leather armor; you've mastered the others.  I won't require you to toil needlessly for the pattern.  You've earned it outright, and then some... but I cannot give it to you myself.  My teacher, the one who brought me into the craft, is the one who must reward you.Take this letter to Telonis; he teaches leatherworking in Darnassus.  Show him the letter, and let him acknowledge you as an equal, as I do."
2854,"<name>, your skill as a leatherworker precedes you.  I possess leatherworking lore you would be wise to acquire... Wild Leather armor!  Wild Leather taps into the potent and chaotic properties of wildvines, found in areas of lush vegetation and on some of the creatures there.  Armor made using it is second to none for a crafter of your skill, guaranteed.I'll teach you, but you'll be working for me for a while.  The first cost is simply ten pieces of thick leather.  After this, we'll talk specifics."
2855,"Wild Leather shoulders support a wearer's frame extremely well, offering superior protection of the upper arms as well as the shoulders.  As with all Wild Leather armor, a random yet very potent enhancement is imbued within the item as the wildvine is stitched in.For this pattern, I will require six thick armor kits and a wildvine.  That shouldn't be too tall of an order for you to fill."
2856,"Wild Leather vests are the staple of any Wild Leather armor set.  The frame of the vest and the wildvine weave within it produces a product that offers maximum protection of the torso while allowing for potent magic to work its way through the garment.For this pattern, I will require two Turtle Scale breastplates, two sets of Turtle Scale gloves, and a wildvine.  This is not an easy lesson, but it is one you certainly have the skill to complete."
2857,"A Wild Leather helmet offers the wearer superior protection to the vital areas of the head without a sacrifice in comfort.  As with all Wild Leather armor, the integrated wildvine yields a powerful but random magic imbuement to the helm's frame.  Leather wearers will definitely want this piece!For this pattern, I will need two Nightscape tunics, 2 Nightscape headbands, and a wildvine.  Complete this lesson and the pattern will be yours!"
2858,"Your knowledge of Wild Leather armor grows, <name>; still, there is more for you to learn.Wild Leather boots are the cornerstone of any set.  Such boots are crafted to cradle the foot in comfort while bracing it against the hazards of adventuring.  The soft soles are a blessing to those seeking quiet movement in footwear.For this pattern, I need two Nightscape pants and two Nightscape boots crafted.  I also will require two wildvines... not just one.  When you have these items, we will proceed."
2859,"You are ready to master more complex lessons, <name>.  Wild Leather leggings are some of the sturdiest and powerful leather gear around.  The waist, thighs, calves, and the vitals - all are given tremendous protection.  Coupled with the enhancement that the wildvine provides, adventurers who own it will thank you each time they see you.For you to gain this pattern, I need two Turtle Scale helms, two Turtle Scale bracers, and two wildvines."
2860,"<name>, you have learned all I am able to teach you.  There is, however, one remaining pattern for Wild Leather armor.  I will not require you to toil needlessly for this; you've earned it outright, and then some.  This pattern, however, is one that I cannot freely share with you.My teacher, the one who brought me into the craft, is the one who must reward you.  Take this note to Una; she teaches leatherworking in Thunder Bluff.  Show her the letter, and let her acknowledge you as an equal, as I do."
2861,"Rumor is that Tabetha, a mage colleague who lives deep in Dustwallow Marsh, has a bone to pick with a certain sand troll in Zul'Farrak.  If you speak with Tabetha she can tell you more."
2862,"The gnolls... they are more than a nuisance.  They are a constant threat to the existence of this very camp!  It is irrelevant whether they are indigenous to Feralas or not; if we do not strengthen our resolve against them, we will find ourselves driven out of the entire region.The gnoll attacks against the camp have become more fevered as of late.  We need your aid in thinning their numbers; bring to me ten of their manes, and I will reward you handsomely for your effort.Go!"
2863,"The plan is for various leaders of the gnolls - Alphas as they call themselves - to be taken down within rapid succession.  If we're able to execute this sort of swift and precise devastation against them, it would cause chaos in their ranks.  Perhaps it would also drive a message through their thick flea-bitten heads that we can and will destroy them!I want you to be the messenger of my will; eliminate five of their Alphas within one hour for this to work <name>, or we'll remain at this impasse!"
2864,"My cousin Tran'rek is in a tight spot.  He promised me a load of scarab shells weeks ago and he hasn't delivered.  He's my cousin, so I'd hate to have to send someone to Gadgetzan to break something on him.Can you speak to Tran'rek for me?  Let him know he needs to get that delivery together before I do something rash?Gadgetzan is in northern Tanaris, in Kalimdor."
2865,"The scarabs of Tanaris have very hard shells!  Hard enough to use as a building material for lots of things.  So many things!In fact, those shells are so useful... the scarabs were hunted all to near extinction!I know where there are more scarabs, and if you promise to bring me their shells then I'll tell you where they are.  Promise?Ok, the scarabs have a colony in Zul'Farrak.  I guess the trolls don't hunt them for their shells.But you can!  Go to Zul'Farrak and get me uncracked shells!"
2866,"To our south are the Ruins of Solarsal; this is an area that far pre-dates modern times.  We explored the ruins initially and found nothing of note; as such, we left it in peace.Very recently, the Hatecrest naga have occupied these ruins in alarming numbers.  At first, we considered it as the precursor for an attack.  Though that threat is still possible, we believe there might be something else going on.Go there, explore the ruins, and look for anything that stands out to you. Good luck, <name>."
2867,"With the discovery of the strange gazebo in the heart of the Ruins of Solarsal, the time has come to return to Feathermoon Stronghold and report to General Shandris Feathermoon what has been discovered here."
2869,"The best course of action at this point is to assume that, regardless of what the naga are up to, they will eventually move to secure the island for their own.  We need to take aggressive steps to counter that threat before it is too late.Bring me ten Hatecrest Scales that are in good condition; it should be obvious to you how to acquire them.  You'll cut your teeth on the naga for the first time, and we'll have a weakened naga presence on Sardor Isle - both are prospects that play to our advantage."
2870,"<name>, new scouting reports have given us a good idea on the naga chain of command.  Royalty is present amongst their rank and file, and they're the ones calling all the shots.Specifically, we've identified one of the crueler royals as Lord Shalzaru.  Scouts report that he himself has uncovered an odd relic during a recent naga excavation in a cave south of the main ruins, across the water on the Isle of Dread.Put a stop to it by putting a stop to him, and bring me his relic so we can study it."
2871,"If you would be so kind as to deliver the relic to my wife Vestia, I would appreciate it.  She's not only a fine priestess for our community, but she is one of the most well-versed scholars you'll find anywhere.  I couldn't make heads or tails of this device even if there was a wager involved.  My wife though, if anyone can figure out what this thing is, she could... and we need to know!She's just around the bend, no doubt studying.  Thanks, <name>."
2872,"My old buddy Stoley owes me a very special bottle of rum.  He tends the bar at Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris, Kalimdor,  and he promised me that the rum there is stronger than anything we can find in Booty Bay.  He's so confident that he says if I try that rum and don't agree with him, then he'll double the money he owes me!Well, I think he's not as confident as he was when last we spoke, and now he's afraid to give me that rum.  But I don't back down from wagers, so why don't you talk to him for me..."
2873,"I owe ""Sea Wolf"" MacKinley in Booty Bay some rum, to settle a bet, but I'm all out of rum!  Captain Cuergo stole my last shipment, and he has it stowed in that walled pirate town to the south.If you can find my shipment of rum and return it to me, then I can prove to MacKinley that Kalimdor's booze beats the dirt out of Booty Bay!"
2874,"Thanks again for your help, <name>.  Here's a bottle of Steamwheedle bilge rum.  Take it to MacKinley and he can finally put to rest his crazy beliefs about Booty Bay booze."
2875,"The vile pirate Andre Firebeard is wanted for crimes against Steamwheedle and Gadgetzan.By decree of governing counsel, any who read this are hereby authorized to use lethal force during the apprehension of Andre and his abettors.By further decree, should Andre be deceased, or otherwise indisposed, during the time of his hearing, his head may act as proxy, and deliverance of such head to Security Chief Bilgewhizzle constitutes a binding, and tenderable, contract."
2876,"This scroll contains the schedules of shipments between Steamwheedle Port and Booty Bay. Both past and future shipments are included, along with ship names, with large 'X's next to some ships' journeys, and annotations like ""GREAT LOOT"" and ""HARD FIGHT"" next to others.Someone at Steamwheedle Port would want to see this document."
2877,"We Wildhammers remember the past, more than our brothers in Ironforge.  If you want to make friends here, then you get your hands dirty for us!The Horde abandoned their positions in the Hinterlands around Skulk Rock; it's now overrun with nasty sludges and oozes.  We've got plans on that area, but first we need a clean-up crew to make a hole for us.That's where you come in, Sunshine!  Head down there and take out ten green sludges and ten jade oozes, then report back to me here.  Move out!"
2879,"This stave might be the Stave of Equinex! The Stave of Equinex is actually a key, used to unlock the Equinex Monolith in the Ruins of Ravenwind, on the mainland west of the Dream Bough.Find the four flames that still burn in those ruins: Samha, Imbel, Byltan, and Lahassa. Retrieve their essence and then while standing by the Equinex Monolith, use the essences to energize the stave. If this is truly is the Stave of Equinex, you will be able to unlock the Monolith and gather a sacred artifact from it."
2880,"Get this straight, <race> - we are NOT part of the Alliance!  The Wildhammers are independent, relying on deeds and actions to prove one's worth, rather than the blather of those who use jibber-jabber to bolster their do-nothing attitudes!If you're looking for friends here, then prove your worth to us first!  The foul trolls that choke the hillsides of the Hinterlands sometimes carry tribal necklaces.  Bring five of them to me, and we'll mark it down as a step in the right direction for you."
2882,"This map shows a stretch of beach with a southern face.  Below the map are words, elegantly written...South of WheedleSouth of homeFind a mast and flag and bonesDig you there, if you be boldDig and claim Cuergo's gold!A key you'll need and a key you'll seeThe men you face take blood as fee."
2902,"Gnolls aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, but they will no doubt have some sort of documented strategy on their recent activity.  If we were to find those plans, then we'd have a clearer idea of what is making them so worked up.I want you to head back to the Woodpaw and find anything that might resemble their battle plans.  They have to have something; their attacks have been too coordinated to be done without them.  Find them, and return to me when you have them."
2903,"With the battle plans of the gnolls discovered, all that now remains is to bring the plans back to Hadoken Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache.  Perhaps he or someone there can make further sense of what the gnolls are up to."
2904,"<Kernobee groans.> Wha.. What happened?The last thing I remember is being captured by a group of dark iron dwarves, beaten to within an inch of my life and then thrown in here with these filthy troggs.Get me out of here, <name>!Here's the plan: Lead me to the exit; if we make it out alive, you go to Booty Bay and let Scooty know that I went to Ratchet to warn Tinkerwiz of the dark iron's involvement in the making of that super rig.Let's get going!"
2922,"When our beloved city Gnomeregan fell, a rogue spark must have jolted my poor creation, Techbot.  It once aided me and my associates with its countless gizmos and limitless store of information, but its positronic brain has polarized.  Now it's negatronic... and Techbot's behaviors are reversed.  It roams Gnomeregan in a frenzy!But perhaps it can be salvaged.  Perhaps, if you can retrieve Techbot's memory core and bring it to me, I can discover the cause of the polarization and fix my poor Techbot."
2923,"Tinkmaster Overspark is very upset with the fate of his mechanical creation, Techbot.  I remember Techbot as a kind and helpful tool for the gnomes, but Overspark tells me it's malfunctioned.Very sad.  But with luck perhaps he can be fixed!Speak with Tinkmaster Overspark, in Tinker Town in Ironforge.  He would welcome your help."
2924,"A nigh-universal mechanical component--the essential artificial--was of great use to the tinkers and smiths of Gnomeregan.  But during the frantic exodus from our city, no one remembered to take any of these devices with them!  And I need a large supply of them for work I will soon undertake.Please, go into Gnomeregan and get me some essential artificials.  You'll find them in the deeper areas of our city, held in containers called artificial extrapolators.Thank you, <name>, and please hurry!"
2925,"A gnome friend, Klockmort Spannerspan, sent word to me from Ironforge.  He tells me he needs help on a dangerous, but essential, mission into Gnomeregan, the once great gnome city now contaminated and filled with mad gnomes and their devices.I must stay here, but my heart aches to help my friend.  If you can go in my stead, then I would be much indebted to you.You may find Klockmort in Tinkertown, in Ironforge."
2926,"Since the accident, all Gnoarn thinks about or talks about is cleansing Gnomeregan of the trogg infestation and finding a cure for the sickness that plagues it, <name>.Luckily, Razzle and I are close to some kind of cure - either that or the recipe for a really powerful rum. We won't know until we test! Naturally, in order to test our theory, we're going to need a few things; namely, fallout from the irradiated troggs in Gnomeregan. Fill up this phial with the green glow and bring it back!"
2927,"You don't think I was always bald, do you? No < sir/ma'am>! It was the radiation leak in Gnomeregan that caused this tragic hair loss. Before that day, I had the only gnomefro in all of Azeroth.<Gnoarn shakes his fist in the air.>Damn those damned dirty troggs - damn them all!!Perhaps it's not too late, <name>. We may still be able to save it - the city I mean! Speak to Ozzie Togglevolt in Kharanos. He and his partner Razzle are working on a solution."
2928,"It's terrible, <name>. We are not going to have enough parts to get our fleet of gyrodrillmatic excavationators to Dun Morogh.What we need are spare parts, <name>. What better place to get the spare parts for our vehicles than Gnomeregan? I hear that bots and mechs roam around that place like cattle on an open range.What I need you to do is go to Gnomeregan and tear apart those robots. Bring me back their robot guts. Two dozen should be sufficient."
2929,"I trusted Thermaplugg, <race>. Never did I expect that he would betray me and the entire gnomish people. And for what? Power? Wealth? All things that he would have had in time. Now we have been displaced from our home and that madman is in charge. The king of nothing....We will retake Gnomeregan, <name>. We will not stop until the city is back in our control. If you wish to join in our fight, a simple task I ask of you: Kill the betrayer. Destroy Mekgineer Thermaplugg."
2930,"When we fled Gnomeregan, we left so much data behind!  Vitally important data!I need the data on a prismatic punch card, from a Matrix Punchograph 3005-D high security terminal, deep in Gnomeregan.  You must access the terminal, but to do that you first need clearance... and to get that you must access lower security terminals-- models -A, -B and -C.  And to do THAT you need security punch cards, starting with white... and we left all the punch cards in the city.It's a catastrophe!  Can you help?"
2931,"Master Mechanic Castpipe in Ironforge has need of adventurers!  He's organizing bands to reenter Gnomeregan on a data retrieval mission of top security and importance.Castpipe might not be a member of the Enlightened Assembly of Arcanology, Alchemy and Engineering Sciences like I am, but he's still a smart gnome so if he thinks it's important, then by my calculations there's an eighty-four percent probability that it really is important!Those are good odds!"
2932,"The Witherbark trolls were once allies to the Horde, but they betrayed Thrall... and that must be punished!Here, take my pike and go to the Hinterlands, far to the north.  You will find it northeast of Tarren Mill, a village held by our allies, the Forsaken.When you enter the Hinterlands, hunt Witherbark trolls.  Gather their skulls and drive my pike into the ground at one of their smaller villages, Hiri'watha or Zun'watha.Show them their vile actions are of consequence!"
2933,"These bottles hold a vile, green venom.Considering the number of bottles in this village, the Witherbarks must deem it very important.  Perhaps an apothecary in nearby Tarren Mill would like a sample."
2934,"I must have a fresh sample of the venom you brought me.  The spiders from which it was gathered must dwell in the Hinterlands -- hunt them until you find an undamaged venom sac and bring it to me.  You will find many spiders near the troll city of Shadra'Alor.Do not tarry, <name>, for the venom sac must be fresh when you deliver it."
2935,"The venom from the broodguards wasn't as potent as the venom you brought originally.  It must have come from a different spider.I want a fresh sample of that venom.  To find out where it came from, you must consult with a troll who knows the Witherbark well--Master Gadrin in Sen'jin Village.  Travel to Durotar and speak with Gadrin.  With luck, he'll know where the Witherbarks get their venom."
2936,"The Witherbarks worship a spider god, and from her they collect their most potent venom.  So if you want the venom, then you must summon their god!To do that, you must know her true name, and that name is on a tablet buried in Tanaris, in the troll city of Zul'Farrak, in a tomb guarded by Theka the Martyr.Defeat Theka and find and read his tablet to discover the spider god's name.  When you know it, return to me."
2937,"Take his parchment, and read it at the altar of Shadra'Alor, deep within the witherbark realm in the Hinterlands.  This will summon Shadra the spider god."
2938,"The venom you gathered from the Witherbark's spider god is quite a find!  I've been able to kill nearly two dozen rabbits with just a drop of the stuff.  Granted, some of those rabbits were very young and small enough to fit in the palm of one's hand so I'm certain their resistance to toxins was low, but it can't be denied that this poison is powerful!I'd like a sample sent to my superior, Apothecary Faranell in the Apothecarium of the Undercity.  I am positive he would want to test this himself."
2939,"While the ruins of Feralas can be quite dangerous, they have much to tell of what has happened here.Searching through the rubble to the south a few days ago, I discovered what appears to be a normal stave. However, I just can't shake the feeling that there is something more to it. Angelas and I have been poring over our books here, but we can't find a thing about it.I have a colleague in Darnassus that may be able to tell us what this is, <name>. Why don't you go talk to her and see if she can help us?"
2940,"This book looks as if no one has opened it for quite a long time. Its covers are quite worn, and its pages yellowed, but after examining it, you notice that it might be just what Troyas is looking for.You pick it up, but realize you should probably ask before borrowing it."
2941,"I have studied many subjects in my time, and my latest fascination is with the snapjaw that occupy the beach in the Hinterlands. There's one in particular I'd like to see, a giant snapjaw named Gammerita. I'd like to go myself, but my research keeps me here. I think a picture of her would be the next best thing.Take this letter to Curgle Cranklehop in Tanaris. She has created an invention for me that can capture a picture. She called it a ""snapshot,"" I think..."
2942,"The moment the artifact is removed from the Monolith, you feel the energy in the Stave of Equinex begin to fade."
2943,"Here it is, <name>. Please, take care of my book.Now, hurry along. I'm sure Troyas is eager for your return."
2944,"Have the first look at my new invention, <name>. All you need to do is target whatever it is you'd like to take a picture of, and push the button.What was that creature from the Hinterlands that you mentioned? Gammerita? Well, good luck finding her. I'm sure Daryn will be quite pleased with the snapshot you return to her.In any case, here's the Super Snapper. Have fun!"
2945,"You have uncovered what appears to be a ring from the corpse of one of the Dark Iron dwarves.  It is difficult to tell what kind of ring it is, however; dirt and hardened residue cake the item completely, making wearing it impossible.  You think you can make out the slight luster of precious metal and maybe even the glint of a gem under the residue.If you are going to make use of this ring, you are going to need to find something to get the hardened residue off of it."
2946,"We want you to take the miniature discs you found to the sealed gates of Uldum.  We... we aren't sure what will happen when you do this.This sounds risky, sure, we acknowledge that.  It might, however, do nothing.  You might need to use the discs on something.  Perhaps the doors unlock when you have the discs in your possession.  Be open to try anything, and be ready for anything to happen.When you've found out what happens, return to Ironforge.  We'll have a lot to analyze when you're done!"
2947,"Opening the box produced by the Sparklematic 5200 reveals what you had suspected - a shiny ring!  Wearing the ring, you feel magic power surge through you body.Inside the band is a small but nonetheless discernable imprint of the seal of Ironforge.  Next to that, three small initials are engraved: ""TdK"".  This may signify either the initials of the previous owner, or perhaps the initials of the ring's crafter.  Keep the ring... or return it to this person.  Decisions, decisions..."
2948,"Listen <name>, that ring is yours, sure... but I can make you a better one!  That design, like I said, is really simple.  I am a lot more skilled now, and for the mere fee of thirty silver coins I'll spruce it up for you!  Well, a little more than thirty, actually...I'm in a tight spot right now; all my material stock is all dried up.  If you bring me a bar of silver and a moss agate, I'll add a silver and agate lattice to the ring that will give it a little more pizzazz!Trust me!"
2949,"Opening the box produced by the Sparklematic 5200 reveals a shiny ring!  Donning the ring, you feel magic power surge through your body.Inside the band is a small but nonetheless discernable imprint of the seal of Orgrimmar.  Engraved letters are next to it, but only the first three stand out even after cleaning: ""NOG...""This may signify either the initials of the previous owner, or perhaps the initials of the ring's crafter.  Keep the ring... or find ""NOG"" - decisions, decisions..."
2950,"No, no, no - I'm not all of the sudden saying that the ring is mine.  I normally don't do this, but your information about the Dark Irons was very useful.  I'll improve your ring for you, better than whomever made this simple little thing could have ever done.  Probably some gnome...If you bring me a bar of silver, a moss agate, and thirty silver coins for my trouble, I'll add a silver and agate lattice to the ring that will strengthen the magic inside of it.  Interested?"
2951,"This contraption stands out amongst the gnomes holding out against the madness outside the room.  A small plaque on the device reads ""The Sparklematic 5200"", followed by some text:""Grime and residue ruining your sparklies?  The Sparklematic 5200 puts the shine back in shine-tastic!  Insert the item you wish to clean and deposit three silver coins in the coin slot.  Give the Sparklematic 5200 a moment for operation, and voila!  Your valuables will emerge clean and shiny!"""
2954,"""Salutations - I am a guardian of entry.  Unless you have the Plates of Uldum already integrated with your disc set, I will not allow for entry into the Uldum compound.""The appearance of the Stone Watcher of Norgannon must be the reaction that was hoped for in sending you out to the Tanaris desert with the platinum discs.  As instructed, you will need to find out what the story behind the Stone Watcher is before continuing on."
2962,"Not only was your sample insufficient in quantity, it was also impure.What we require is more green glow. The troggs are obviously not irradiated sufficiently to fulfill our needs. You will have to go into Gnomeregan and bring back some radioactive fallout, straight from the tap. I am speaking of the irradiated slimes, lurkers and horrors. Be warned, the containment of this type of fallout is difficult. You may need to make several attempts with the phial until a suitable sampling is recovered."
2963,"Greetings once again, <name>!  Your discovery inside Uldaman has set the Explorers' League abuzz with excitement.  The League has been working to unlock the secrets of the miniature platinum discs you found.  Your fortuitous arrival here in the Hall allows me to share with you that we are quite possibly on to something!Historian Karnik has uncovered some important clues as to the true origins of the Valley of the Watchers in the Tanaris desert.  He would like to speak with you as soon as possible!"
2964,"Well <name>... we seem to be at a temporary dead end here.  We know what we need - the Plates of Uldum - but we have no idea where they might be.  We'll need to do quite a bit of research on this to come up with a solid plan of attack.  I have a couple ideas where to start looking; I have high hopes that soon, we'll be asking you to head out and recover them.The High Explorer needs to be informed on this, <name>; no doubt, he also wants to thank you personally for once again aiding the League."
2965,"Ah, <name>, it is fortuitous that you have come to me again.  Your revelations at the Uldaman dig site have certainly given us sages much discuss.  I was doing just that with one of the druids, Nara Wildmane, when it dawned on me that her past adventuring experiences may have some great importance as to the next step we need to take.I would like for you to speak with her concerning her travels to the Valley of the Watchers in the Tanaris desert.  She waits for you on the Elder Rise."
2966,"Sage Truthseeker and I would like you to take the miniature discs you found to the sealed gates of Uldum.  We... we aren't sure what will happen when you do this.This sounds risky, sure, we acknowledge that.  It might, however, do nothing.  You might need to use the discs on something.  Perhaps the doors unlock when you have the discs in your possession.  Be open to try anything, and be ready for anything to happen.Learn what you can, then return to me. We will have much to discuss."
2967,"You access the pedestal again; the platinum discs suddenly appear once more in your backpack.With the knowledge of the stone watcher learned and the discs returned to your possession, the time has come to return to Thunder Bluff and inform the Nara Wildmane of your discovery."
2968,"Well <name>... we seem to be at an unfortunate impasse.  We know what we need - the Plates of Uldum - but we have no idea where they might be.  We will research this, and then devise a solid plan of attack.  I have a couple ideas where to start looking; I have high hopes that soon, we'll be asking you to rejoin our efforts to discover the truth.Sage Truthseeker needs to be informed on this, <name>; no doubt, he also wants to thank you personally for once again heeding the call."
2969,"The filthy Grimtotem clan are capturing faerie dragons, <name>. Jer'kai and I have no idea what they plan on doing with them, but they're obviously up to no good.We're not powerful enough to fight our way into the camp and free the captured dragons, but perhaps with your help...If you're willing, and you have some strong friends, release the creatures from their cage with this key and make sure they escape with their lives. I'll be by your side the entire time. Jer'kai will remain here."
2970,"As she's already told you, Kindal and I will now take the fight to the Grimtotem. Together, we should still be able to pick off some of the tauren without much threat to ourselves, but we'd love some help if you're willing and able.You've seen the camp below us, but there are more to the east. Using your own tactics, deal as much damage to the tauren as you can. We can all meet back here after they've felt the sting of Kindal's arrows and your own weapons."
2972,"Out here in the wilderness, Kindal and I have meager means to reward your help, but we don't want you to feel unappreciated. Take my signet ring. If you ever find yourself in the boughs of Teldrassil, go to the Temple of the Moon in the heart of Darnassus. There you will find my High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind. The ring will let her know that we are well and give credit to your story.We both thank you, <name>."
2973,"Well met, <class>. I've traveled with my companions down to the Feralas on a mission for our Orgrimmar masters.My life-mate Korrin finds great pleasure in new clothing, so I aim to make her a new cloak adorned with the gossamer wings of faerie dragons. Would you be able to help me? Sprite darters with gorgeous wings I want are west of Camp Mojache."
2974,"What!? You came across tauren in the area? You're joking! What did they look like!?The Grimtotem clan! You found some of them? Belgrom, one of our masters, has an interest in their kind... he's even put a bounty on them.You have to go back, <class>. Go back and bring me their horns... piles of them if you can. The Grimtotem are not to be trifled with or underestimated. Go back and slay them; let the rivers in Feralas run red with their dark blood."
2975,"The effects of the Gordunni Ogre tribe can hardly go unnoticed in this area. Look around, <name>; their very presence scars this land. We must push them back before they expand even further into Feralas.Follow the river north, and you will find their outpost. Decrease their numbers, <name>. We must show them that their kind is not wanted here."
2976,"What?!Ah, so I did mention a bounty, didn't I? Well, that'll teach me to open my mouth, won't it?You did the work, so I suppose it is only right you reap the greatest reward from it. Take the horns, I'll have them put in a crate for you.

2977,"You access the pedestal again; the platinum discs suddenly appear once more in your backpack.With the knowledge of the stone watcher learned and the discs returned to your possession, the time has come to return to Ironforge and inform the Explorers' League of your discovery."
2978,"Picking up the soiled scroll, you notice that it seems to be depicting some sort of meeting or ceremony. Rok Orhan would be interested in this scroll, and what it might mean to the Gordunni."
2979,"These seem to be plans for some sort of dark ceremony, <name>. From what I can make out, this ritual is conducted by the Gordunni mage-lords.Find one of these mage-lords, and from him, gather an orb.The orb of a mage contains great power, and will help us discover more about this ceremony and the magic that the Gordunni wield."
2980,"Now that you have proven that you are a true fighter, I trust that you possess the courage to continue with the task at hand.Travel to the High Wilderness, southwest of here. There lie some abandoned and destroyed structures, on land that once belonged to the night elves. Look for these ruins, and when you see the withered trees and desecrated terrain, you will find the Gordunni. Push them back.These ogres are much stronger than the ones you faced previously, <name>. Be aware."
2981,"Feralas is an ideal location for an accomplished <class> to prove <himself/herself>. A tribe of ogres called the Gordunni are the dominant military force there, and their numbers are growing. They must be stopped before they threaten our presence in Feralas.A warrior I know of named Rok Orhan resides at Camp Mojache in Feralas; go to her. She will tell you more of the situation when you arrive."
2982,"Although it is dangerous, Troyas and I have been investigating the ruins that cover the forests of Feralas.Lately, though, Troyas has been going on his own to the High Wilderness, and I really worry about him. The Gordunni Ogres have taken over that area, and they don't take kindly to anyone that enters their territory.I was hoping you might be willing to travel to the ruins to the southeast and clear out some of the ogres. Make it a little safer for my Troyas, and I will be extremely grateful."
2983,"It's been some time since you were tested last, <name>. You've been patient thus far in your studies, but it's time for you to learn about greater powers... it's time you learn real power. The element of fire is yours if you're prepared to pay for it.Seek out Kranal Fiss in the Barrens. He lives in a small dwelling north of the Crossroads, but be mindful, if you've reached the blasted night elf lands, you've gone way too far."
2984,"Long has it been since you were last tested, <name>. You have shown patience thus far in your studies, but the time has come for you to learn more. The time has come for you to learn about destruction... and chaos. The element of fire is yours for the understanding, if you're prepared to pay for it.Seek out Kranal Fiss in the Barrens. He lives in a small dwelling north of the Crossroads, but be mindful, if you've reached the night elf lands, you've gone too far."
2985,"You look ready for your next test, <name>. You've been patient in your studies, but the time has come for you to learn more. The time has come for you to learn about the purity of water.Seek out Islen Waterseer in the Barrens. She is along the eastern coast, south of the Southfury River and Ratchet. You will find her there at her fishing hut. Good luck to you, <name>."

2987,"I just arrived here in Feralas, and I've heard that the Gordunni Ogres that inhabit the wilds here have some interesting minerals. Who knows what they are up to, but they sure are protective of that stuff! They don't leave it just lying around; no, they bury it to protect folks like me from getting their hands on it.If you'd be willing, I'll give you my shovel. Go to the Gordunni Outpost north of here and dig me up some Gordunni cobalt. Look for the blue glow, then start digging!"
2988,"The son of our mightiest gryphon is gone! Swiftwing's heir, Sharpbeak, was lost while hunting with his parents a few days ago, and we believe it was the trolls who took him.You must aid us!  Search the cages in the two Witherbark troll villages to see if Sharpbeak is there."
2989,Sharpbeak was not with the Witherbark trolls.  Perhaps the Vilebranch trolls took him.  Go to the Altar of Zul on the western edge of Vilebranch territory and search for the gryphon child.
2990,"Take this feather to Thadius Grimshade, the diviner.  He left Aerie Peak years ago to pursue darker knowledge, but in his heart he is still a Wildhammer!And perhaps his talents can help us find Sharpbeak.This feather was taken from the nest where the gryphon child sleeps.  If you give it to Thadius then, with luck, he can use his divining magics to find Sharpbeak.Good luck, <name>.  You will find Thadius in the Blasted Lands, in the mage tower of Nethergarde Keep."
2991,"I'll find out where your gryphon is, but first you have to do something for me.  There's a troll in Zul'Farrak, Nekrum Gutchewer, who possesses a medallion I would very much like to study.  Bring me that Medallion and I'll use my powers to find Sharpbeak.Zul'Farrak is across the ocean to the west, in the desert of Tanaris."
2992,"Give me room while I perform a ritual of divination.  I will find the connection between the feather you brought me and its owner, and follow that connection to Sharpbeak himself.That is... I will if all goes according to plan.  If it does not, then... you better close your eyes."
2993,"Sharpbeak is held in a cage, high on a cliff at the top of Jintha'Alor in the Hinterlands.  The key to this cage is possessed by the high priestess of the Vilebranch trolls, Vile Priestess Hexx.There.  I have done my part.  I bid you fortune on your quest, <name>."
2994,"We must save Sharpbeak!Fight your way to the top of Jintha'Alor in the heart of Vilebranch territory, gain the key to Sharpbeak's cage from the vile Priestess Hexx, and then find and save Sharpbeak!"
2995,"The Quel'Danil Lodge is a center of communication for the high elves of the Hinterlands. Their ambassadors are working to establish relationships with other races, with whom they share their knowledge of the Witherbark trolls that inhabit the area in the southern Hinterlands. All of the documents regarding the communications are kept at the lodge.We don't need the Highvale building alliances with others, <name>.Destroy the Highvale documents.  We need to burn their lines of communication... literally."
2996,"I have taught you skills in the past, but the time has come for another to teach you. He is in Ratchet, and his name is Strahad.

He is in Ratchet... above the port town next to his tower."

2998,"Greetings, <brother/sister>. Duthorian Rall, one of our most influential paladins, was speaking about you recently. I overheard him talking about how it was time you be put to the test some... along with some very complimentary things about how well you've performed thus far.If I were you, I'd head to Stormwind and speak to him when you have time. I'm sure he's in the Cathedral of Light--that's where he spends most of his time."

3062,"Edana Hatetalon is the queen of the Northspring harpies that reside in the ruins to the west. She is pure evil; I have heard that her heart is one of crystal. She is void of any emotion aside from the hate she feels towards all others. You must face Edana and bring me back her dark heart.I have heard of a horn that harpies carry -- blowing it by the Hatetalon stones, in the northern part of the ruins, will summon the queen.Imagine her surprise when it is not her kin calling her, but her death."
3063,"In my day, I was a seasoned hunter. There wasn't any creature around that I feared. Until...I was out in the forest, sharpening my blade after a tough battle, when I was ambushed. Harpies surrounded me, and I barely managed to drag myself to safety.Even now, I can still hear their cries echoing...I was never the same after that. But the hate boils inside of me -- I must get even, after all these years.The Northspring harpies can be found to the west of here. <name>, get my revenge."

It's a shrunken head that I promised Neeru in exchange for the herbs. It's the head of some poor dwarf I ventured across in the forest. I'm sure Neeru will be pleased.You'll find Neeru in the Cleft of Shadow."
3122,"Here are the herbs, <name>. Take them to Witch Doctor Uzer'i.Please let him know that I am satisfied with the shrunken head."
3123,"This will be a test; both of the ritual I performed, and of your abilities. Take this vessel, <name>. With it, you will have the power to shrink and capture a creature inside of it.Travel to the Hinterlands and look for creatures known as Wildkin that were once pets of the night elf goddess Elune. The vicious, primitive, or savage owlbeasts are your targets, <name>. Kill 10, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them before their spirits can escape."
3124,"Since you have proven that you are both trustworthy and gifted with the ability to use the muisek vessel, I now wish you to capture another creature.Hippogryphs have been loyal companions to the night elves for many years; their spirits are loyal and steadfast.Your task is to kill 10 frayfeather hippogryphs, and quickly, shrink and capture them with the vessel, so that their muisek may be preserved. You will find the hippogryphs in the High Wilderness, to the south of here."
3125,"<name>, next I must have you capture a creature that in appearance, may look quite fragile, yet its powerful spirit is what we are truly after. The faerie dragons that I speak of have served the night elves as their allies. We must capture one so that the horde may benefit from this strength of spirit as well.Here is the muisek, <name>. Kill 8 sprite darters or sprite dragons, and capture their muisek. They may be found to the west of here."
3126,"The wandering forest walkers that can be found meandering through the forest are our next target, <name>. Night elves have enlisted treants as allies to fight against the horde. Their movement may be slow, but their role as protectors is undeniable.Soon we will be able to use this power for our own benefit.Find 3 wandering forest walkers; kill them, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them."
3127,"The last task I will require of you is to travel to the northwest and find the final enemy.The mountain giants left the mountains to aid the night elves when the burning legion appeared in the world. You will know them by their massive size and the way the ground begins to shake as you travel along their rocky terrain.I am eager to harness power of that size. Kill 7 mountain giants, then use the muisek vessel to capture their powerful muisek."
3128,"I will need certain materials to complete my endeavor... You may do this alongside the other tasks I will give you.I'll need a splintered log from a treant of Feralas. Encrusted minerals, these can be found on the mountain giants and faerie dragons to the west. Also, find me some resilient sinew from the owlbeasts of the Hinterlands or hippogryphs of Feralas. Finally, I'll need a large amount of metallic fragments from any of these creatures I mentioned."
3129,"Imbuing the muisek into the weapons is a difficult process. Now that I have all of the required materials and the muisek of the creatures that you captured, I may begin. Please wait; I will return in a moment."
3130,"At this point, I am going to direct you to my second, Latronicus.  He's been keeping a close eye on the naga forces to date.  I'll assess the general situation here in regards to the naga; as much as I want to commit a full force to move against them, leaving the stronghold open to direct attack from the Horde - or worse - seems less than optimal.Anyway, Latronicus awaits.  Good work thus far, <name>.  Keep it up.You're dismissed."
3141,So you wish to battle demons? You would do well to listen to my tale.
3161,"<name>, I'm a scientist, but also a treasure hunter at heart!Long ago, when trolls used to occupy this land, they created large amounts of ornaments modeled after Gahz'rilla, a hydra they worshipped as a deity. These ornaments are carved out of an element that I call ""Gahz'ridian,"" after the hydra god.I did find some myself, but I'd like to have some more to study -- maybe you can find some?I even invented a detector that makes finding the Gahz'ridian a snap! Just put it on, and the search begins!"
3181,"The gigantic horn has numerous scratches and cracks. An unusual metal object is lodged into the rough surface.Upon further examination, you notice that the metal is actually a broken axe head. On the metal, the following words are etched:Property of Mountaineer Pebblebitty.When you try and dislodge the broken axe head, it shatters into a million pieces.Woops!"
3182,"You expect me to believe a story like that? The real horn would have had my broken axe head still lodged into its surface.Listen, take that obvious fake to Curator Thorius in Ironforge. If he can validate your claim, you will receive a proof of deed. Bring that proof back to me and I'll give you the key to the Searing Gorge.Get going!"
3201,"I can't believe Pebblebitty doubted the authenticity of the horn. Between you and me, I think she's just jealous. I know she really wanted to kill that beast herself, what with the 'incident' and all.So you need a proof of deed? After the contribution you just made to the museum, it won't be a problem.<Curator Thorius begins to fill out a large document.>There we go! You can take that back to Pebblebitty."
3221,"While you were out helping our deathstalkers, Apothecary Renferrel sent you a summons.  He did not give me details, but he wanted to speak with you about the wolf hearts you had given him."
3261,"Your time with me is over, <name>.  To learn more, you must go to Camp Taurajo to the south and speak with Jorn Skyseer.  He will continue your guidance."
3281,"You may have killed the raptors, but the silver they stole must be recovered!  I have reports that the raptors have a large grouping of nests south of Ratchet, known as the Raptor Grounds.  It is likely that they brought our stolen silver there.Go to this raptor haven and search for the stolen silver.  When you find it, return it to me."
3301,"My clanmate, Mura Runetotem, traveled to Silverpine so that she might aid our undead allies.  Silverpine is an ailing forest, a dying forest, and it was Mura's hope to bring it new life.  Perhaps the strange life found here in the Barrens can help her work in Silverpine.Take a sample of the shells you gathered, and bring it to Mura in Silverpine.  She is staying at the Sepulcher.  With luck, studying the shell will give her the insight she needs to heal that dying place."
3321,"You have done much for the Order, <name>. The sheer dedication it takes to get this far would have turned away any ordinary person. There is no doubt in my mind, or in the mind of Galvan, that you are one of us.Which is why I think you deserve a little reward. It is nothing really, just a trinket. You may be familiar with its properties, as I do believe it is what brought you to us in the first place."
3341,"In the Barrens lies a horrid mess of tangled vines called Razorfen Downs. While our first observations of this place revealed little threat, our recent findings are much more serious...The quilboar of Razorfen Downs have aligned themselves with the Scourge. A Lich named Amnennar the Coldbringer rules them now, using the power of his massive consciousness to control their every move.Amnennar has a direct telepathic link to Ner'zhul; we must sever this bond, <name>. An end must come to the Coldbringer."
3361,"We drove the troggs out of Gnomeregan, but then it all went so horribly wrong!  Now our home is completely irradiated, and we gnomes have been scattered all over Dun Morogh.In my haste to get away from the radiation, I lost all my personal belongings and tools.  It was the trolls that got them.  They stole my chest, my box, and my bucket of bolts!  They took them back to their camps southwest of Anvilmar.I'm no adventurer - could you find my things and bring them here to me, please?"
3362,"Have you ever seen Thistleshrub Valley? It's a mighty dangerous place, <name>.Those strange beasts there, I don't trust them for a minute! Gnarled thistleshrubs and thistleshrub rootshapers, that's what I think they were called...Anyhow, I want to get into the valley, but with so many of those thistleshrubs around, there's no way I'm going back there. But here's where you come in -- if you clear some of them out, I just might think about going back. What do you think, <name>? Help me out?"
3364,"Gah!  I was supposed to get this delicious scalding mornbrew to Durnan Furcutter inside Anvilmar a while ago now, but I had to deliver one to Grelin here first.  I'll never make it to Anvilmar before the brew runs cold!You look fast.  Maybe you can make it.  This cup will only stay hot for five more minutes, and Durnan didn't order ""chilly"" mornbrew, so get going.  Anvilmar is to the northeast, a settlement dug into the mountain.Thanks, <name>, and don't forget to bring me back my mug!"
3365,"Now that hit the spot!  Nothing like a piping hot - nay, SCALDING mornbrew on a cold winter's day to warm your cackles of yer soul.Here ya go <name> - be a pal and take this empty mug back to Nori for me, would ya now."
3367,"<Dorius groans.>I'm badly injured, <race>. Feel... light headed... World spinning... Bleeding... internally.I must get back to Ironforge. Help me, <name>."
3368,"Brother,If you are reading this letter, I am no more. How it got to you, I do not know, but thank and reward the ones responsible.About the stones: They exist and the Dark Irons have them in their possession. Their leader, Lathoric the Black, is using the power of the stones to enslave my excavation team. They were taken to the cauldron. Their minds are twisted, working night and day to complete something called Obsidion.Help them, brother. It is the final wish of a dead man.-Dorius"
3369,"This shard holds great secrets; it is the pure essence of the Emerald Dream. However, what I see in this shard is not a dream; one would call this sort of a vision a nightmare.I do not wish to alarm you, <name>, but I think it is best if you deliver this shard into the hands of a wise druid as soon as you can.Hamuul Runetotem on Elder Rise is who you need to find. Head to Thunder Bluff. I cannot say more."
3370,"This shard holds great secrets; it is the pure essence of the Emerald Dream. However, what I see in this shard is not a dream; one would call this sort of a vision a nightmare.I do not wish to alarm you, <name>, but I think it is best if you deliver this shard into the hands of a wise druid as soon as you can...Mathrengyl Bearwalker in the Cenarion Circle is who you need to find. Head to Darnassus. I cannot say more."
3371,"There is an empty, vacuous hole, where my heart used to be, <name>. The loss of Dorius is not one that I will soon recover from. I must see his final wish through - the perpetrators of this cold blooded murder must be brought to justice.Return to the Searing Gorge and fulfill his last request: Free his men. The Dark Iron dwarves force their slaves to work in a sweltering mine called the Slag Pits. Search there for Dorius' men."
3372,"Release them, <race>. Even after their bodies give out, the power of the Suntara forces them to complete their tasks.The altar of Suntara is the key. Go northwest; in the hills above the cave... Twilight's Hammer guard a relic. Retrieve it and place it on the altar of Suntara.<The dying archaeologist collapses.>"
3373,"As you touch the gem, a deep voice resonates in your mind.""Mortal, heed this plea.  I am Eranikus of the Green Dragonflight, keeper of this accursed temple.  My charge to ensure that the trolls never again bring forth their abomination of a god has for now ended in failure.  As I imbue this gem with part of my essence, I sense my grip on the Dream twisting into chaos.  Please - place this gem into the essence font in my lair, and let our magic there purge the taint from my psyche so that I may rest."""
3374,"You engage the Oathstone, and Itharius speaks directly to your mind through the stone.""By accepting the charge placed in this Oathstone, you agree to aid my cause and the cause of Ysera's Dragonflight in redeeming the corrupted soul of Eranikus.  The first sacrifice, one of many you and I will no doubt make, will be to relinquish the gem to me that has chained what free-willed part of Eranikus' psyche remains.""""Do this <name>, and we will work together to redeem a soul worthy of redemption."""
3375,"Um... you need another phial of scrying?  You're kidding, right?  What did you do with the first one?!  We have a lot of work ahead of us here, <race>.  Those phials don't grow on trees!  Actually, I wish they did, because I'd go there and pick one off since I don't have another one!!in order to make you one, I need the following: a mana potion, a piece of coal, and some sweet nectar.  Don't ask why, just bring me what I ask and I'll make you a new one."
3376,"<name> - I have heard of you, newcomer.  Perhaps it is you that will help us, where others have failed.We tauren have carved a home out of this land, but not without a cost.  The Bristleback quilboars of Brambleblade Ravine, led by Chief Sharptusk Thornmantle, have made our lives difficult with their continued war against us.  I charge you to bring me the chief's head!He will be found in the ravine to the east in their makeshift village."
3377,"Will you assist me, mortal? Hear my tale."
3378,"Will you assist me, mortal? Will you find the prayer to Elune?As I stated, the prayer was etched onto a golden tablet. One of these idol worshipping scoundrels must have it on their person.If you do recover my prayer, take it to Astarii Starseeker in Darnassus. It matters little that my faith has been rekindled after the countless malevolent actions that I have taken against this world and its inhabitants, but my prayer must be heard. Absolution is the last thing I expect."
3379,"The spiders of the Searing Gorge are an invaluable source of shadow silk. As you know, shadow silk is highly sought after by the artisans of our trade.Recently, a group of poachers has encroached upon these lands, carelessly slaying spiders en masse without so much as a thought as to the long term effect of their actions. The first task I ask of you, then, is a simple one: Find them... and end them.Begin your search to the north.If you require assistance, speak with Raze."
3380,"There are restless spirits in this world, <name>. There are spirits that have been tainted by their isolation, bound to an ancient evil...I have heard of a place that lies deep below the surface of the earth -- banished there by powers greater than I have ever seen.If you wish to learn more of this place; the Sunken Temple, seek out a goblin named Marvon Rivetseeker. He has studied many ancient areas of the world, and was last known to have left his home in Ratchet to study the troll ruins in Tanaris."
3382,"We were just off the coast looking for a safe haven to make anchor. The sun hadn't been down for more than an hour when they attacked... those damned naga!I'm not sure what they were looking for, but it's clear they didn't find it--they've already come back once. A couple of my scouts are on watch at the entrance of the valley to give us fair warning when the next attack comes.I'm sorry you've come along now, <name>, but it's out of my hands.Are you ready for the fight of your life?"
3385,"They call themselves the Undermarket: Cutthroat traders that will sell, move, trade and do just about anything for the right price.It gets worse, <name>. They have set up a base of operations here in the Searing Gorge. Trade Master Kovic is heading up the operation and has close ties with the Dark Iron dwarves of the region.We must strike hard and send a message to their leadership. Slay Trade Master Kovic and his minion Clunk. Bring back his trader's satchel when the job is done.To the Cauldron!"
3402,I want you to personally deliver the news of Kovic's defeat to Vizzklick in Gadgetzan. He will be so happy to hear that Kovic is dead that I'm certain he'll give you some grand reward.
3441,"Hear my tale, adventurer."
3442,"You have made the right decision, <name>.We must strike where we will do the most damage: the four sentry towers.With the four towers in flames, we can initiate an offensive before they have time to react.You will need the proper tool to set the towers ablaze. To make the tool requires some materials.Bring me four hearts of flame and four golem oil and I shall craft the torch of flawless flame.The golems and elementals in these lands should be your first target."
3443,"To hold the flawless flame, we will need a shaft and a casing. You must first find a suitable shaft.The Dark Iron taskmasters and slavers of the cauldron use weapons of enchanted thorium, an extremely sturdy alloy. If you bring me eight thorium plated daggers, I can break the alloy down and reforge a shaft."
3444,"I once entered the foreboding chambers of the Sunken Temple. The evil in that place penetrates all that enter; I barely managed to find my way out, wading through the ooze that now covers the floors. All I can remember is stumbling through a large circular room, filled with serpent statues...Recently, I discovered a round stone that appeared to have the same serpent symbol imprinted on it. I had it packed up and shipped to my workshop in Ratchet. Retrieve it, and I might be able to tell you more."
3445,"I have heard of a place that lies deep below the surface of the earth -- banished there by powers greater than I have ever seen.If you wish to learn more of this place; the Sunken Temple, seek out a goblin named Marvon Rivetseeker. Much like Troyas and I, he has studied many ancient areas of the world. He was last known to have left his home in Ratchet to study the troll ruins in Tanaris.Good luck finding him; he hasn't been heard from in some time."
3446,"Inside the temple, I found a circular room with six balconies, each one with a serpent statue on the edge. Curious, I pushed one of them to see what would happen, and it was a trap! I nearly fell to my death from the explosion. Laying there on the ledge, I looked down and noticed that there was another statue at the base of the room; an altar of sorts... Hakkar, I think it was called.I think that this altar is the secret -- you must bring this token to the altar in the Sunken Temple."
3447,"My memories are cloudy, but I will tell you what I can. The circle of statues in the Sunken Temple, while dangerous, I believe that they hold the secret to unlock an even greater treasure.From the main altar, I was able to activate a series of lights. I think that if you can uncover what these lights mean, you might be able to unlock whatever secrets are hiding in this room.I warn you though, <name>. Great evil lies in the temple. It's likely that anything valuable will be fervently guarded..."
3448,"I've recently been handed the responsibility of investigating Azshara--a once beautiful area the elves called home. This would be back when they practiced magic. It's now a more dangerous place than it is beautiful, but that doesn't stop us from turning over every stone for answers to our past.A companion of mine named Tymor offered to help me investigate the area since he takes a particular interest in such things.He owns a small place to the right of the Hall of Mysteries here in the city."
3449,"Magic was once as revered as Elune herself to some elves. Some of their most powerful mages created runes and tablets citing rules of the arcane and insights into their findings. They would leave these for all to ponder in public places.I would very much like rubbings of these runes from the Ruins of Eldarath. I have a kit for you to make the rubbings with, but it will be up to you to find them. Be careful though, the Explorer's League isn't the only one interested in Eldarath."
3450,"I want the rubbings delivered to my tower, but there's no need to have you go all the way there. I'll just have them air-lifted out of Azshara.Xiggs Fuselighter owes me a favor or two and will be in the area soon--he's signed on to patrol the coast. Speak to him before you leave. He can give you a flare gun to signal him with. When you have the rubbings, just head to wherever he tells you and then give them to him so he can get them to my tower safely. He should be in the hangar in the Military Ward."
3451,"Ah, so Tymor sent you, huh? Yeah, I owe him a favor or two. What's that? Why, that little devil. Yeah, I can help him out with that. So you'll need a flare gun and a location... easy enough.There's a small island off the southern peninsula of Azshara that we've made a landing pad on. You take this flare gun, and use it there. I'll see your signal and come by to pick up this... whatever it is he wants."
3452,We need one final piece to form the torch.In the mountains to the northwest you will find a large encampment of Twilight's Hammer. It is rumored that they carry symbols and idols that pay homage to their god. These symbols and idols could carry sufficient enchantment to form a magical casing. Bring me a single symbol of Ragnaros and I will try to extract the magic from the item to create the casing.
3453,Give me a moment to combine the pieces and apply the necessary enchantments.
3454,"The torch must now be bound to its owner. Pick up the torch, <name>."
3461,"Tymor didn't give me anything to pay you with, so I suggest you take it up with him when you get back to Ironforge. I'm sure he'll still be in his place in the Mystic Ward. Just go knockin' and make sure he pays you good. This place ain't no picnic... that's for sure.Thanks again for helping him out though, and good luck.Oh, and I don't need the drawing kit. Why don't you just bring it back to Tymor when you go to see him?"
3462,"Speak with my envoy, Squire Maltrake. He will further instruct you as to the use of the Torch of Retribution."
3463,"Listen well, <name>. While the four towers can never be destroyed, you can use the torch of retribution to set them ablaze for a very long period of time: A fire that no element or force can subdue.While they are ablaze, no guard or sentry unit can inhabit the watch posts and thus, their first line of defense is nullified.You must enter each tower and use the Torch of Retribution within their fortifications. Beware the lookouts posted by the Dark Irons, <name>."
3481,The chest appears locked.
3501,"Although you may never find a flawless sphere of draenethyst, you will undoubtedly uncover various imperfect fragments of the draenethyst in your exploration of these lands.While it is doubtful that Kum'isha will be able to use the flawed fragments to return home, the pieces may serve other, useful purposes for the draenei.Return any piece of flawed draenethyst fragments that you may find and I shall reward you."
3502,"Well, after that display of voracious greed, I feel nauseous.Regardless, I shall not dwell too long on your material addiction.For each imperfect draenethyst fragment you turn in, I shall reward you with more junk. My junk heap gets smaller while your junk heap gets larger. On Draenor we call this a 'win-win' situation."
3504,"Betraying, thieving woman! That's what I call her--that's all she'll ever be!I may have made a grave mistake, <name>. I trusted a blood elf. What's worse, I trusted a woman!She claimed Azshara would hold great riches... powerful items. I simply send some warriors with her to protect her and I would be rewarded. Well, look who's the fool--she's killed them all.I want vengeance, <name>, but I can't afford to send anyone else. Find Ag'tor at Valormok, north of the Haldarr Encampment. He'll tell you more."
3505,I thought as much.We start our crusade against her workers along the southern bluffs on the northern peninsula of Azshara. Kill them with bloody rage--let them know they've betrayed the wrong allies.Do not concern yourself with her yet--she spends most of her time with her bodyguards searching Azshara. It would be prudent after you've slain her workers to find her personal camp. Scouting out where we can attack her would be wise. Perhaps there is something there we can use to provoke her.
3506,"A few more moments of thought brings a few ideas to mind, one of which brings a smile to your face: perhaps destroying the crystals would upset the blood elf responsible for the slaughter of so many orcs and the betrayal of Belgrom?You continue to decipher more of the script and pictures and realize that one of the crystals is tied to the creator of the circle--the others are tied to something far more sinister.You close the book and begin to decide which crystal to destroy."
3507,"Return to Belgrom in Orgrimmar. He will want to see her head for himself! We'll return there shortly.Ah, this is indeed a good day. Thank you for your help, <name>."
3508,"You are foolhardy, <name>. It is an admirable quality of your kind - to blindly enter battle when you have little to no chance of success. I will assist you, if only to see just one of Razelikh's minions fall.To break the ward placed over Razelikh's subordinates will take time and require the acquisition of rare artifacts.Be still, I must first perform the enlightenment ritual. The information I gather will assist me in forging weapons of great power."
3509,"There is only one way to harm the demon lord and his minions. A weapon of power must be forged bearing his true name.When such a weapon is forged, the demon and all under his command are vulnerable.A lesser deity resides in Azshara: Lord Arkkoroc. You must seek him out but be warned, his minions will stop at nothing to destroy you if you are discovered.Undoubtedly, you will have to pay a price for such information."
3510,"She kills my children, mortal. She that calls herself the ruler of these oceans. A false god, nothing more. Crush her and bring back all of her heads.For that, you will be given the name that you seek and something else of equal importance.She roams the clutch... Hetaera she is called.<Lord Arkkoroc points to the southwest.>Go!"
3511,"As promised, I will reveal the name of the demon lord, Razelikh the Defiler. First, however, I must prepare something of utmost importance for your journey.The weapon you seek to create requires a temper. Give me a moment to drain the blood from these heads.<Lord Arkkoroc squeezes the heads in between his gigantic fists, draining them of their blood.>Take the temper back to Loramus along with the name of the beast: Rakh'likh."
3512,"<name>, our first step will be to devise a method to speak with Eranikus through the gem.  He lies in a precarious state between sleep and death now, twisted within a weave of nightmares.  Though the essence you have given me is badly tainted, there is a chance we can reach him.Travel far to the icy lands of eastern Winterspring and seek one of our mortal allies, Umbranse the Spiritspeaker.  He is a human medium who speaks for the dead.  Though Eranikus is not truly dead, he may be of aid to us still."
3513,"The official-looking scroll is wrapped tightly with a silvery ribbon. You're sure someone would be interested in seeing this, but who?There is an outpost close to the Ashenvale border to the north, and if the information on this scroll involves the night elves, this would be the place to take it."
3514,"This scroll is from that scheming dryad Rynthariel, Keymaster of the Talon Den on Stonetalon Peak.She'll not be making any more contact with the messenger you looted this from, heh, but we must stand our ground here. The Horde will not tolerate her outrunners here.<name>, travel to the Talon Den. Kill Rynthariel, and then put up a symbol for all to see. Take this Horde flag, <name>. Put it up in the Talon Den so that they will not be so rash as to send another messenger through our territory again."
3517,"I admit, <name>, I've made the most of my situation in Azshara. Belgrom's punishment has had its share of benefits.Before I left, I did some research and you would be surprised how many valuable items are lying around.I'll tell you more about my deals, and even give you a cut of the profits, if you help me gather some of them.There are tablets throughout the Ruins of Eldarath to the east that I need. All four are named after Highborne wizards. Get them for me and we'll talk some more."
3518,"The first tablet goes to a tauren female... one called Magatha. She is among the elders in Thunder Bluff, and is one of the proponents of the alliance between the tauren and the Forsaken. She, more than anyone among the elders, feels the tauren and their ways can help the Forsaken find a path back to being human.Bring her the Tablet of Beth'Amara. The tablet may be the link she needs in finding a way to help the Forsaken... or so she claims."
3519,Ughhh... I was bitten very badly by a spider named Githyiss the Vile while exploring the spider cave very close to here. I am sure I have been seriously poisoned; you must help me.Please tell Dirania Silvershine. She will be able to help me.Hurry... I'm so dizzy...
3520,"I seek the spirits of the vale screechers of Feralas.  They are the cousins of an old, old god, and their spirits are linked to him.Take this bramble wand and go to Feralas.  Find and defeat vale screechers in southern and central Feralas, then wave my bramble over their fallen bodies.  This will coax their spirit to reveal itself.  Touch the spirit and collect its essence.Return to me with my bramble and with the collected essence, and I will tell you more of the old god of which I spoke."
3521,"We may be able to help Iverron, as I know of an antidote that should help with the poison. It requires some ingredients, though, before I can make it.I'll need Hyacinth mushrooms. You can find these growing under trees, or you may collect them from the grell south of here; they seem to have taken a liking to them. I'll also need Moonpetal lilies, which only grow around watery pools.The last ingredient may prove the most difficult. From the very spiders that poisoned Iverron, collect Webwood ichor."
3522,"The antidote is ready, <name>. Please see that Iverron drinks it.There is something that you should know -- the antidote -- it will only remain viable for 5 minutes. You must get it to him in time.Speed be with you, <name>."
3523,"Outstanding!  My name is Belnistrasz, and I thank you for rescuing me.  I had given myself up for dead... or worse, as a meal for these Scourge-infested vermin.  Yes - I said Scourge all right; they've brokered some sort of deal with the Quilboar here, and this nightmare is a result.Listen... rather than just flee, I want to make a difference for all of our sakes.  Would you be up to helping me out to that end?  It's probably dangerous, but you seem to be the type not to worry about that too much."
3524,"Majestic sea creatures are known to launch themselves at the Darkshore coastline, beached there until they die. Lately, these beasts have been washing ashore in ever-increasing numbers.  I've been sent here by the Temple of the Moon to investigate, but the presence of murlocs along the water has made my research difficult.There is a giant creature washed ashore just south of Auberdine that is ringed by the foul Greymist murlocs.  Could you go there and retrieve bones from the creature for our study?"
3525,"Near the entrance is an idol that functions as a macabre oven for the Quilboar; the beasts... they literally consume their abductees from the Barrens.  I can shut down the idol and bind them from using it again, but I need your aid in doing so.  My plan: escort me to the idol.  Once we arrive, I'll commence the ritual.  I'll barely be able to communicate with you, let alone defend myself.  Protect me while I shut down the idol.  If they take me down, then it's all over for us.Are you with me?!"
3526,"Expert engineering yields two distinct disciplines: gnome and goblin.  Clearly, goblin engineering is the choice of all brilliant engineers.  Learn to master the world through the judicious use of high explosives and fantastic gear!<name>, read this manual.  If you want to learn about goblin engineering, then take it to Nixx Sprocketspring in Gadgetzan.   Remember - membership is permanent and prevents joining the other discipline, so make sure this is what you want before finishing his task."
3527,"The ancient prophecy of Mosh'aru speaks of a way to contain the god Hakkar's essence.  It was written on two tablets and taken to the troll city of Zul'Farrak, west of Gadgetzan.Bring me the Mosh'aru tablets!The first tablet is held by the long-dead troll Theka the Martyr.  It is said his persecutors were cursed into scarabs and now scuttle about his shrine.The second tablet is held by the hydromancer Velratha, near the sacred pool of Gahz'rilla.When you have the tablets, bring them to me."
3528,"Now it is time to capture the essence of the avatar of Hakkar.Take the Egg of Hakkar to the Sanctum of the Fallen God in the Sunken Temple in Azeroth.  Invoke the egg's power to stir the dead god.He will send his minions against you.  Defeat his bloodrinkers and take their Hakkari blood, then use the blood to dowse the eternal flames that hold Hakkar's spirit.  When all the flames go out, the avatar of Hakkar will enter our world.Defeat him, and place his essence within the egg of Hakkar."
3541,"I have a fence in Orgrimmar. He resides in The Drag. He's difficult to nail down if you don't know where to look, but if you go looking in one of the highest buildings there you should have no problem finding him.Do me a favor though, don't go shouting to all of Kalimdor that he's there and what his business is--it'd be bad for both of us.He'll give us more than a fair price for the Tablet of Jin'yael. I'm not sure why, but you should have seen how excited he was to hear about its whereabouts."
3542,Andron Gant is my next contact. He usually holds himself up in the Undercity... right near the Apothecarium.He was a little more loose-lipped when it came to speaking about what he wanted the Tablet for. Apparently some of the mages of Undercity are looking to study some of the arcane spells the highborne used. They think this tablet will help them. Markri was adept at summoning creatures; especially elementals.Take the Tablet of Markri and return to me for your part of the reward.
3561,"This final tablet goes to someone very dangerous, <name>. Heed me when I tell you that I trust this person far less than anyone else I've asked you to meet with.Archmage Xylem has a tower up in the hills overlooking Azshara. He's human, but he acts like no human I've met... or killed. He exudes power, and I dare not ask him what he plans on doing with the tablet.He came to me, but told me that his bodyguard Sanath would help me get to the tower when I was ready to meet him. Look north for Sanath."
3562,"Take this note to Jediga. Tell her the payment will be here for her when she returns. And tell her I am pleased with her work.Go swiftly, <name>. Tell your master I will be awaiting her here."
3563,"Take this letter to Jediga. Let her know that our deal has been beneficial and I be pleased with her work.You tell her she come back to Orgrimmar fast and Jes'rimon make sure he take good care of her.Tell her that, and maybe in the future I have need of your services again, <name>."
3564,Here... take... <hic> this to Jediga. Good luck to ya!
3565,"What is it? Oh yes, your payment. Of course.Take this and be off with you. I'm sure Jediga is awaiting oh so patiently for your return."
3566,It... It... It was all a trap.Forgive... me.Kill the bastard... Kill him for us... for Thorius.
3568,"See that tauren behind me--the one who looks like she's going to be ill at any moment? She was in Azshara recently. She claims she was wounded by some naga while making her way through the Ruins of Eldarath.After fighting off a few of them, she took a break on the beach and drank from one of the tide pools. Now she's feeling nauseous... among other things.I'd like to find out what she drank. Take this box, in it are some empty vials I labeled. Fill each at different pools and come back."
3569,Give this to Thersa. Perhaps it will cure her... perhaps not. We really won't know until after she drinks it.
3601,"Kim'jael indeed!! Do you know what Kim'jael means to the Blood elves, <name>? Little rat... or something like that. The big bullies!They hired me to help them scout the area looking for some sort of lost treasures. Of course I jumped aboard the moment they said ""treasure"" and the amount they were willing to pay, but of course, they turned on me and tried to kill me... ME!Goes to show you, you can't trust a Blood elf.The problem is, they still have my equipment and I can't get it back. Help me out?"
3602,"The ancient cliff giants of the southern region of Azshara consume the rock and buildings of the land for sustenance. The excrement from their consumption is a highly malleable and extremely strong crystal known as Azsharite.The formations litter the southern arc, but few are ever recovered due to the extremely violent nature of the giants.You are to venture south and recover enough of the Azsharite for the creation of the weapon's body. My felhounds will aid in the recovery of the crystal."
3621,"The weapons are ready to be forged. You must take the tempered azsharite to one with the ability to harness fel energy.In Stranglethorn Vale such a blacksmith exists. Galvan the Ancient, leader of the Mithril Order, will craft the weapons to your specifications. You will find his encampment between Zul'Gurub and the Mosh'Ogg ogre mound.May your determination and faith carry you through this ordeal. Should you fail, know that your God smiles down upon you, mortal."
3625,"<name>, the creation of each weapon will take some time.Additionally, you may only use the power of the Felcurse once per three minutes. Its weakening properties against Razelikh the Defiler and his minions may be variable in duration. This is why you must release the Felcurse only when the moment is right!Now give me a moment to craft your weapon, <name>."
3626,"The hour of redemption is near, <name>. You must return to the Blasted Lands with your new-found weaponry and speak with the Fallen Hero of the Horde to receive your final objective."
3627,"To reach the Defiler, you must first destroy the triad of power and recover the amulet pieces. When you recover all three pieces, return to me and I shall give you further instruction.Go <name>! To the Blasted Lands! Sevine, Allistarj, and Grol must fall!"
3628,"Razelikh's lair is atop the highest mountain in the Blasted Lands. The only way to the lair is through the use of the teleport runes near the mountain. As long as you hold the amulet, you can freely transport up to the lair. Once you reach the lair, you must conjure the beast. The amulet is your key, <name>. Use it on the Altar of the Defiler.Should you defeat the Defiler, bring back his horn. It will become a symbol of hope for all that view it - proof that heroes do exist in this war torn world."
3629,"Expert engineering yields two distinct disciplines: gnome and goblin.  I only bother to mention goblin engineering because I'm a fair trainer.

I'm interested - nay, concerned with why the Arch Druid in Darnassus is using the name of the Cenarion Circle as well as the Circle's resources to procure vast amounts of morrowgrain.  I'm a researcher - curses are my specialty.

Can you believe it? That's my wife!I can't leave my post, <name>, but I must know what became of Sha'ni. Travel to the Burning Steppes and search for her."
3822,"My whole platoon was captured, <name>. All were slain - except me.Their leader, Krom'Grul, wanted to save me for some sort of ritual.I was chained to this altar and brutalized by the beast. My physical being ceased functioning after an hour of this torture. The beast then ripped my wedding nose-ring off of my face and stuck it on his finger. I had never seen such savagery!Find Krom'Grul and kill him! Take my ring back to Thal'trak.And <name>, tell him that we will meet again... in another life."
3823,"We must strike at our enemies before they strike at us!I'll make this brief, soldier.The Firegut ogres of the Burning Steppes are allies of the Blackrock orcs. They work closely with those vile orcs, keeping the mineral rich Dreadmaul Rock guarded and the supply lines open at all times.Leave your mark, <name>. Cripple their forces and return to me when the job is done.<Oralius grabs at the air and makes a choking motion.>I WILL KILL YOU, WINKY!"
3824,"They're reeling I tell you! Our next strike must be decisive.The brute lord, Gor'tesh, must be slain. More importantly, his head must be returned to me so that I may prepare the third phase of our attack on the Firegut ogres.Be warned, soldier, Gor'tesh rules not from Dreadmaul Rock but from a Blackrock orc structure to the west of Dreadmaul Rock.Your orders, then, are simple. Find Gor'tesh and chop off his fat head. Return to me when the job is done.SHUT UP, WINKY!"
3825,"Just one last thing you must do, soldier.I've taken the liberty of putting Gor'tesh's head on a pike. Now all you have to do is take this head to the top of Dreadmaul Rock and stick it into the ground. Once you do that, watch as those cowardly ogres run for their lives! After you've had your fun, come back to me and I'll reward you for all of your hard work.<Oralius seems to be losing touch with reality.>"
3841,"Oh, hello, <name>. I'm so glad to see you again. How was your trip to Darnassus?Well, you'll be happy to know that we've made quite a bit of progress while you've been gone. We even saved a nest full of eggs. Unfortunately, the mother died before we got to her.Say, would you want one for a pet? They look to hatch soon, so they'll need a good <father/mother>. What do you say?If you're really interested, take one of the eggs to Quentin at the race tracks in Shimmering Flats. He'll tell you more."
3842,"The Moonweavers, huh? Most intriguing. I wish the sprite darters could truly appreciate what it means to have those two look after them. They are both quite capable.So, they gave you the egg as a gift. Well, then you should be responsible for it for as long as you desire. It appears it's almost ready to hatch, but we should ensure it's healthy and no damage has been done to it.I only need two elixirs of fortitude for a small spell to protect the egg. I have the rest of the components here with me."
3843,"A magnificent specimen, <name>. If this creature survives gestation, then it'll be a healthy pet indeed!There is one last thing I would suggest doing if you plan on following through with this--head to Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands. Speak to a dwarf there named Agnar Beastamer, he's a master animal handler and should be able to guide you in the final steps of incubation.But hurry, <name>, this egg is fragile and will not last long without proper care."
3844,"A destroyed raft rests along the shoreline. Considering this is only a small pond, it is not clear as to how it ended up here, although looking at the trees tells you that the water level may not be constant.Perhaps a little exploration in the area might uncover more clues..."
3845,"Grabbing onto it, you pull the pack back to the shore. Perhaps if you examine the items inside the pack, you might find out more about who it belongs to.There are a few stray travelers at Marshal's Refuge. Perhaps you might find out more there."
3861,"""Cluck... cluck... cluck... BACAW!Cluck... cluck... cluck.""The chicken looks up at you and then starts to scratch its claws into the ground. You think it is spelling out a word, but you are not sure what it is. Could it be... S-A-L-D-E-A-N? Before you can ask, the chicken turns away and goes about its business."
3881,"I don't know how you made it here, but you're a sight for sore eyes!  I'm Williden Marshal, and I lead a non-aligned expedition troupe.  Our latest and greatest endeavor has met with what seems like countless disasters, the most serious of which being that we underestimated the savagery of Un'Goro Crater!As we fled our base camps in the southwestern and northeastern parts of the crater, we left behind vital supplies.  You look like you're capable enough - can you help us by getting them back?"
3882,"You'd think that being chief digger for Marshal Expeditions means I like digging.  There might be worse things to do in this world... but none really leap to mind.We were supposed to be digging in Terror Run - FANTASTIC name by the way - for dead stegodons and diemetradons.  Well, there are plenty of live ones there too!  Wil and Hol are still all about studying this death trap, so we need those dinosaur bones.  Between you and me though, bringing some from live ones will work out just as well."
3883,"Just because we've suffered a setback doesn't mean that research must stop!  We were investigating the Gorishi insects in the southern part of the crater before winding up here.  Their presence is alien to the ecology of Un'Goro, and we want to find out why.In their hive network must be larval hatcheries.  You can identify these places by their hanging larval spawns.  Use this vial to take a sample of the hive wall near any of the hatcheries.  Bring it back to me for study, but be careful!"
3884,"You have uncovered a mangled journal.  Parts of it remain legible, with a Williden Marshal claiming ownership over the contents therein.  If the journal is accurate, then Williden may be found somewhere in the northern part of the Crater; according to the journal, he and his companions sought higher ground from the savage beasts of the Crater once their base camps were overrun."
3901,"You've shown your potential to the Forsaken under normal circumstances <name> - now let's see you under pressure.The Rattlecage skeletons, more mindless minions of the Lich King, are a tougher foe than the zombies you have faced thus far.  Again, thin their numbers and prove yourself to the Forsaken.  Do not tarry - when you are done, speak to me again."
3902,"You there!  If you're looking for something to make yourself useful, then listen up!We need fresh out-of-the-ground recruits to head into Deathknell and search for any sort of useful equipment.  Most likely, they'll be in stacks of boxes.  We expect more recruits to be rising soon, and unless we want them to stumble about naked we had better get to scavenging!Well get to work, you miserable bag of bones!  I'm not going to reward those without some hustle."
3903,"You've shown yourself a dependable <class>, <name>.  Dependable, and not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh?I have a friend, Milly Osworth, who's in some trouble.  She's over with her wagon on the other side of the abbey, near the stable.  I'm sure she could use a pair of hands like yours."
3904,"A gang of brigands, the Defias, moved into the Northshire Vineyards while I was harvesting!  I reported it to the Northshire guards and they assured me they'd take care of things, but... I'm afraid for my crop of grapes!  If the Defias don't steal them then I fear our guards will trample them when they chase away the thugs.Please, you must help me!  I gathered most of my grapes into buckets, but I left them in the vineyards to the southeast.Bring me those buckets!  Save my harvest!"
3905,"Now that my crop is saved, take this Grape Manifest to Brother Neals.  He manages the store of food and drink in Northshire, and I'm sure he'll be delighted to hear that he has fresh grapes.You'll find Brother Neals in the abbey, in the bell tower... where he likes to taste his wine."
3906,"The elders have felt a disturbance amongst the elements. The Dark Iron dwarves have summoned a foul spirit into our world that threatens to plague our lands with an eternal draught. This disharmony of flame must be investigated.Travel to Blackrock Mountain, through the Chasm of Flame, into the quarry. It is there that you shall find this lord of fire: Overmaster Pyron.End the disruption and return to me."
3907,"I can taste the foulness in the air that surrounds you, <name>. There is another, hidden in the depths of Blackrock, who does control this foulness.The wind and earth cry his name: Lord Incendius... but someone... something... commands this being. He is merely an emissary.Find him and discover where his master hides. Return to me when you have collected this information."
3908,"You see, I have no idea how I ended up here. No one really knows -- it's a secret to everybody! I just can't seem to remember anything...These items you brought to me, though... I am remembering something.My sword. I am supposed to strengthen it somehow, but I'm really not sure why. Sorry I can't tell you more, but I just don't remember!Anyhoo, I do know where you can take it -- Donova Snowden in Winterspring. You'll find her by the hot springs. She can temper the sword by the pools there."
3909,"Now, what's this? Linken... FORGOT?Oh, I see... Lost his memory...Well, here is his sword. It's not complete, though. I know of the one that can finish it, but... speaking with him may prove difficult.Listen, I know of someone that will be able to help you. It's too much to explain right now, but you must somehow acquire a Videre Elixir. The only one I know that can help you with that is Gregan Brewspewer. He's hard to track down, but last I knew he was camping in the wilds of Feralas."
3912,"This elixir will allow you to speak with one that you would not normally even see...Take the Videre elixir, along with Linken's sword, to the graveyard just outside Gadgetzan in Tanaris. Once there, drink the potion. You may be quite surprised at the results, but do not be alarmed.In your ""other"" form, head due north until you reach the mountains. You'll find the one you need to speak with in one of the rocky crevices. His name is Gaeriyan.Remember, he will only speak to you in that form..."
3913,"If you return to the graveyard, <name>, you will find a gravestone there... Not just any gravestone; this one will stand out from the others. Secrets lie within it.Push on the stone, and you will learn of these secrets..."
3914,"After a strong flash of light, you are able to pick up the sword again. It has been transformed!"
3921,"I think I might have broken that Samophlange.  That's not good, because I already told some colleagues in Undermine about it and they were very intrigued.  We must find a way to fix it!Take the broken samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket, just south of Mor'shan Rampart, the horde outpost between the Barrens and Ashenvale.  She is very clever and inquisitive.  If you show her the samophlange I bet she'd jump at the chance to fix it."
3922,"I want to fix this samophlange, but to do that I'm going to need some supplies.  I ran out of seventeen-point-five gauge nugget slugs and I'm going to need a bunch of those for the work ahead.The closest place to get them is the Sludge Fen to the east.  The Venture Company usually keeps them in their tool buckets.  Go to the Sludge Fen and look in the tool buckets you find there, then return to me when you've gathered enough nugget slugs."
3923,"Well, that didn't work.  I put some extra gauges on the samophlange to measure its structural integrity, and they read the integrity at an all-time low.  I could add some more dials and maybe a lever or two to try and fix it, but... I think that might make things even worse.You should take the samophlange to Rilli Greasygob.  He used to work for the Venture Company -- if anyone knows how to fix it, it's Rilli.You can find him at Nogg's Machine Shop in Orgrimmar, in the Valley of Honor."
3924,"I think I can fix the samophlange, but I'm going to need the user's manual first.  When I was in the Venture Company I had a rival, Boss Copperplug, who hoarded the secrets of the samophlange, giving out small bits of knowledge on the device to those he trusted.  I wasn't one of the trusted few...Boss Copperplug used to stay at the Boulder Lode Mine in northeastern Barrens.  Get the manual from him, and if he's given pages from it to anyone, you'll have to collect them too."
3941,"Thinking... Thinking... I know I came here for something important...I have an idea, <name>. In the cave over there is a gnome named J.D. that was very kind to me when I first arrived here. Perhaps in my disoriented state, I might have mentioned something to her.Why don't you go ask her if she knows anything? Oh, but be careful -- she's always messing with those crazy glowing crystals I've seen in the crater. I'm not quite sure what she's up to in there!"
3942,"Oh... Linken? Yeah, he's a funny one. When he first got here, he was mumbling about all kinds of strange things. Probably got bumped on the head pretty hard, I imagine.Something he said kinda stuck with me though -- that he was making some sort of totem; said he had to talk to someone named Eridan Bluewind... in a place called Felwood, I think?I doubt he could tell you much now, though. If you want to know more, maybe you should look for Eridan yourself?"
3961,"To think all this time that the reason Linken came here was to rid us of Blazerunner... He seems like such an ordinary guy, but I did notice that he's not at all interested in any of my experiments or gadgets like most gnomes would be. He must be a true warrior at heart.Bring the totem to him. See if that helps him remember why he came here."
3962,"<name>, I finally remember now... I did come here to fight Blazerunner. I was on a journey, and this was to be the last step.But I am no longer the hero... You are. All that you have done -- you must finish this now, not me.Blazerunner guards an artifact called the Golden Flame. It provides power more vast than anything else I have ever known, and it is dangerous in the hands of one with an evil heart.You will want to bring others with you -- it's dangerous to go alone. Take this as my advice."
3981,"Poor Gargal... didn't even see it coming. WHAM! The arrow landed dead center on the top of his head. He was no genius before but now...<Galamav grimaces.>When we dislodged the arrow, we noticed a rolled up note attached to the shaft. On the note was a crudely drawn picture of an orc behind bars with the signature of Commander Gor'shak attached.If he's still alive in the Depths, you'll have to find him.A trap you say? Well no kidding, numb hooves! That's why you're going!"
3982,I was sent here under the auspices of Thrall. Do you actually think these buffoons could capture me? I allowed myself to be captured so that I could gather intelligence.<Gor'shak whispers.>The Princess of Ironforge has been kidnapped by Emperor Thaurissan. Princess Bronzebeard is in this very city! I bet old Magni's heart almost stopped when he heard that news.<Gor'shak laughs.>Shhh! Do you hear that? Guards coming! DEFEND YOURSELF!
4001,"So far, my communication with the dwarf, Kharan, in the cell across the hall, has been limited. I have, however, managed to convince him that I, rather -we- mean him no harm.Go speak with him and gather as much information about the Princess and her captors as possible. Take that information back to the Warchief.Thrall does not want the Princess harmed, but instead, has some grand plan laid out, which includes her being safely returned to Ironforge. Kharan already knows all of this... Go!"
4002,"You bring excellent information, <name>.As Warchief, it is my duty to do what is best for the Horde. To ensure that the generations that come after us are not forced into a hopeless existence.The opportunity to shape our future alliances has fallen into our collective laps. A move to help the dwarves could greatly strengthen our relationships in the Eastern Kingdoms. This, then, is why you must not fail!Are you prepared?"
4003,"This strike against the Dark Iron dwarves, if successful, will send a shockwave throughout their entire kingdom.Princess Bronzebeard is under the control of Emperor Thaurissan. To free her, you must kill the Emperor. Be warned, your task is doubly dangerous, as Bronzebeard will attack you without question while under the control of the Emperor.DO NOT HARM HER!"
4004,"You have slain my husband, <race>! My child will be born into this world without a father.<Princess Moira points directly at you.>I assure you, this child will be the next ruler of the kingdom of Ironforge. You and your kind shall be hunted down until the end of days for this wrongful act.<You think that Princess Moira may be suffering from the residual effect of Thaurissan's spell.>Leave me be, <race>. I am certain your warchief will be eager to hear the results of his meddling."
4005,"Take this bag of supplies with you to Tanaris. Travel to Lost Rigger Cove, and look for a circle of stones.The eastmost peninsula is the secret...From this circle only, read from the book of Aquor; summon the only creature that can transform the items you collected into a totem to fight Blazerunner.Aquementas will not be pleased to be awakened, but remember, you must remain in the circle for him to transform the items."
4021,"The Horde commends your successes against the Kolkar, but the Kolkar themselves are maddened.  I have reports that a contingent of Kolkar has traveled to the Barrens from their home in Desolace, to seek vengeance.  My latest report was that, even now, they move against these bunkers, from the west!Face the Kolkar invaders, and end their threat in the Barrens.  Kill them until their leader, Warlord Krom'zar, appears.  Defeat him and bring me a piece of his banner as proof.We're counting on you, <name>."
4022,"The flight is aware of your work in the Searing Gorge.Show it to me, <race>. The molt, imbecile."
4023,"You seek out the Flight? Present to me proof of your worth, mortal."
4024,"I wish to taste the searing flames of the mountain of fire. To let the molten fires of Blackrock cascade across my being. That essence, that searing heat, it is what I crave.Bael'Gar resides in the Depths of Blackrock: A being of pure flame, born of the fires of Ragnaros. Slay Bael'Gar and from his smoldering remains bring for me a piece of his inner fire.Use the molt on his remains to safely extract the inner flame.Succeed and be rewarded."
4061,"The machines made themselves known to us during our initial forays into the Searing Gorge. Upon further investigation we discovered that they were being imported from Burning Steppes, possibly Blackrock Depths. That is what we need you for, <name>.Your first task is to venture to the Burning Steppes and recover elemental shards from the rock automatons and lesser rock creations of the region. Once you have collected a sufficient amount, return to me and I shall determine their source of origin."
4062,G.L.A.Those are the 'initials' imprinted on the elemental shards. Below the initials are a rank marking of some sort. The machinations you destroyed in the Burning Steppes were of 'Rank IV.' I assume that this is a lowly rank.Take this shard sample to Lotwil Veriatus in the camp to the east. He is a scholar of some renown in the field of elemental sciences. He may be able to assist us in our search.
4063,"This can't be Argelmach! Argelmach was killed ten years ago. How can I be sure? I was the one who killed him.He was a despicable dwarf, hell-bent on twisting my life's work to meet his diabolical needs. It seems that the wicked always find a way to escape justice.If this is Argelmach's handiwork then he must be destroyed. I will need samplings of his latest creations. With the proper samples, I may be able to stop this uprising. The creations guard Argelmach in Blackrock Depths."
4081,"By order of Warlord Goretooth, commander of the Kargath Expeditionary Force:Any and all of General Angerforge's forces within Blackrock Depths must be annihilated.Angerforge's men are ruthless killers, responsible for the mass murder of the 109th division of the Kargath Expeditionary Force. Heroes are warned to exercise extreme caution when confronting these brutes.Any person who destroys the first line of General Angerforge's forces in Blackrock Depths shall receive a tribute."
4082,"By order of Warlord Goretooth, commander of the Kargath Expeditionary Force:Head of the K.E.F. reconnaissance division, Grandmaster Lexlort, has returned with news of the whereabouts of high ranking Dark Iron officials. Through locked gate, near the heart of the city, they train their forces to snuff out our men. Travel to Blackrock Depths and destroy them!Completion of this mission will result in a tribute."
4084,"I do not know the one you speak of, <name>.But worry not; if your friend was on a journey to find me, I do know what it was he desired.In the heart of Un'Goro Crater dwells evil of the purest form. This evil takes the shape of an elemental called Blazerunner... protected by an aura that none can dispel...None... except those with enough power to do so. I can teach you of this power, <name>.First, do as I ask. Collect 11 Silvery Claws and 1 Irontree Heart from the creatures in Felwood, then return."
4101,"Plants give life to Felwood, yet even they suffer the taint of corruption.  I know ways to cleanse them, but I cannot give out such knowledge to those I don't know or trust.  Prove to me that you will truly aid the cause of the Cenarion Circle!To the north lie the Irontree Caverns.  The Warpwood elementals present there are now beyond hope of cleansing.  I ask you to bring me their sap - blood amber it is called - so I may study it in the hopes of saving other forms of life here."
4102,"Plants give life to Felwood, yet even they suffer the taint of corruption.  I know ways to cleanse them, but I cannot give out such knowledge to those I don't know or trust.  Prove to me that you will truly aid the cause of the Cenarion Circle!To the north lie the Irontree Caverns.  The Warpwood elementals present there are now beyond hope of cleansing.  I ask you to bring me their sap - blood amber it is called - so I may study it in the hopes of saving other forms of life here."
4120,"Being a hunter, I strive to emulate the strengths I see in my opponents. It is possible to turn the battle in your favor by simply knowing your enemy well, <name>.In a place called Felwood, north of Ashenvale, the creatures have been tainted by a substance called fel. The bears and wolves have been driven mad by it, but I believe that they have also grown even stronger as well.Go, <name>. Travel to Felwood and face these beasts. Learn for yourself if they are truly as strong as I believe."
4121,Do you truly believe that you will make it to your rendezvous point with me in custody? You actually expected to break into a heavily fortified Blackrock fortress to capture a prized asset of theirs without alerting anyone or anything to your presence?You will be destroyed!
4122,"I tracked him across the Searing Gorge, through the mountain, and into the Burning Steppes. That traitor was caught red-handed giving the Blackrock orcs vital information about our day to day operations. I'm speaking of Grark Lorkrub.He now sits in the Burning Steppes, safely under their protection - or so he thinks.Take these shackles, <name>. Find Grark, place the shackles on him and lead him through Blackrock Mountain. Do this and a tribute is yours."
4123,"For years I have sought a certain gem.  It is called the Heart of the Mountain and it's the size of your fist!  The Dark Iron dwarves have it locked in their vault and, try as I may, they won't let me purchase it.So I must resort to force.Fight your way to the Lower Vault of Blackrock Depths, breach its secret safe and gain the Heart.  To do that, you must defeat Watchman Doomgrip, and he won't appear until you've opened every relic coffer in the vault!Good luck."
4124,"An associate of mine, Ginro Hearthkindle, is looking for assistance concerning the location of a courier and the parcels he was carrying.  It has been a week or so since the courier went missing; our own searches have proved fruitless, and we're at an impasse.  Unfortunately, I have had to declare the courier as missing in action.If you have the time and resources to spare, please speak with Ginro.  He should be here in the Stronghold - perhaps in his quarters."
4125,"It's been about a week since Raschal, the courier, set out for Thalanaar.  He knows Feralas well; he's been with us since General Feathermoon led the expeditionary forces here.  I know his plan was to take a row boat down the coast and try and traverse across southern Feralas to avoid the Horde camp.I couldn't find his boat, but maybe you can.  Maybe it is hidden, or maybe it was sunk.  Regardless, it might hold a clue as to where he is.  If you uncover something, please let me know."
4126,"The Dark Iron dwarves, led by the villain Hurley Blackbreath, stole one of the Thunderbrew's best recipes, Thunderbrew Lager.  The villains!  They don't deserve such a fine brew!<name>, I have a tough task for you.  Go to the Blackrock Depths in the Burning Steppes, destroy any kegs of Thunderbrew Lager you find, and bring back our recipe for Thunderbrew Lager!Please, get that recipe back, even if you have to turn Blackrock Depths upside down to do it!"
4127,"Running your hand along the mud, your fingers graze the handle of a knife.  It looks well cared for, and it might be safe to assume that whoever was on the boat might have lost it.  Perhaps the large chunk of the missing boat might have something to do with the loss.You grab the knife, remembering that Ginro Hearthkindle in the Feathermoon Stronghold instructed you to return to him with any found clues.  You get the feeling, however, that you are not quite alone in the water..."
4128,"Ho, <name>.  I heard that Ragnar Thunderbrew is steaming mad about someone stealing his ale.  He's looking for stalwart adventurers, and willing to pay plenty.Talk to Ragnar if you're interested.  He's at the Thunderbrew Distillery in Kharanos, in Dun Morogh."
4129,"The Stronghold's resident druid, Quintis Jonespyre, has some... unusual skills.  One of them involves psychometry - the ability to reveal an item's history by touch.  Don't ask me how he does it; I chalk it up to magic I do not and choose not to understand.  I do know, however, two things: one, I've seen it work and two, the bum owes me.Take the knife up to Quint in his little tree-house here, and tell him for me that his Kalimdor Hold 'Em debt will be paid if he works his mojo on that knife."
4130,"I'm a little wobbly still, sorry.  Anyway, I received some useful visions.Raschal takes two large leather backpacks from his boat and goes inland; he returns to the boat, however.  I see gnoll scalps... he ran into some gnolls - Woodpaw I think they're called.  He's very worried - almost terrified - about something.  So much so, that he is not paying attention to water elementals forming behind him.  The images... stop there.I need to rest, sorry <name>.  Tell Gin what I've seen.  He needs to know."
4131,"Our ""friends"" the Woodpaw might have gotten Raschal in the end, but something tells me that's not what occurred.  Still, they're the best place to start looking.I wish I had clearer insight as to what to do, but all I have right now is 'Search the Woodpaw camps - go.'  I do know that gnolls will keep items they scavenge and fight over them; maybe they ran across the backpacks Quint mentioned.  I hadn't risked a head-on fight in past searches, but with Quint's vision on this I say rip into them."
4132,"You have done an exemplary job, <name>. It is now time to send you on your last mission.General Angerforge, the Dark Iron responsible for coordinating the attacks on the 109th division of the K.E.F. and the mass slaughter of our forces must be brought to justice.This will undoubtedly be your most grueling mission, but should you succeed, you will be richly rewarded."
4133,"Shadowmaster Vivian Lagrave is in need of your services.  She is in the Badlands, in the orcish outpost of Kargath, pursuing rumors of a certain brew made by the Dark Iron dwarves of Blackrock Depths.Speak with Vivian.  She awaits you."
4134,"It is rumored that the Dark Iron Hurley Blackbreath has stolen a recipe for ale.  This ale, Thunderbrew Lager, is said to infuse its imbiber with great strength and courage.  We wish to study the drink.  Perhaps, we will find other applications for its virtues... applications more in line with Forsaken objectives.Delve into Blackrock Depths, find Hurley, take from him the recipe for Thunderbrew lager and bring it to me.And to find him, you may have to entice him by threatening his precious ale."
4135,"Inside the backpacks are two items: the first is a parcel of goods that was bound for Thalanaar, and the second is a note hastily penned to an unknown reader.The note tells of discovering insidious bug-like creatures south of the gnoll camps in a place called the Writhing Deep.  The author felt the need to investigate it personally, as though it was a serious threat to all of Feralas.  The note is signed, ""Raschal of Feathermoon"".It would seem that you have located where Raschal ultimately went."
4136,"My brother Ribbly has always been a drain to his family, taking our money and wasting it on one scheme after another.Well, his last scheme must have been his worst, because Baron Revilgaz of Booty Bay just put a price on poor Ribbly's head.  I can't tell you how happy this makes the Screwspigots!  Our little Ribbly's finally worth something!But now he's hiding out, deep in Blackrock Depths.  Please, find him and bring him to me!Or, if he won't come, then that's ok... just bring me his head."
4141,"See Larion over there? It's HIS fault we're here!I told him we were going the wrong way, but would he listen? And would you believe that he's the one that won't speak to me? Well, until he changes his mind, let's have a bit of fun with him.Have you noticed the strange plant-like creatures around here? They're nothing but trouble, really, but I think if trained properly, I could get them to obey commands.First thing though, I'll need some samples to study. Do you think you could collect some?"
4142,"I'm not quite sure what to make of this, <name>. The plants... they seem to have some minimal intelligence.I'm no expert, though. But, I do know someone that is!Head to northern Feralas, and look for a buddy of mine named Gregan Brewspewer. He's an expert on this sort of thing.I'm sure Gregan can help us out here. You'll find him out in the wilderness; he's not the type to live in a big city."
4143,"To tell you the truth, <name>, I've never seen any plants like this in my travels. Perhaps I should take a trip to this crater...At any rate, I think I know just the thing Muigin's looking for -- Atal'ai haze. It's horrid stuff, hard to collect, but it's just what he needs to control the little monsters.You'll need to visit the temple of Atal'Hakkar in the Swamp of Sorrows. The Atal'ai Haze can be collected from the deep lurkers, murk worms, or oozes found there. Good luck, <name>!"
4145,"See Muigin over there? It's HIS fault we're lost!I'm the one that knew the way, but he insisted he knew a shortcut, and we ended up here!To make matters worse, now he keeps sending his crazy plant pests to annoy me. I'm so angry that I'm not planning on talking to him any time soon, but these pests are too much to handle.Why don't we try to limit his supply, first thing. Go out and hunt some Bloodpetals, then return to me."
4146,"You're in luck, <name>! I've been working on some of my own experiments while Marvon's been gone, and one of them is a short range bug zapper. With just a few adjustments, it should be great for ridding yourself of those Bloodpetal pests.I can let you have one of my zapper prototypes, but you'll still need to collect the fuel. You can get the necessary Atal'ai haze that the zapper needs in the temple of Atal'Hakkar. The deep lurkers, murk worms, or oozes are the ones you'll need to get it from."
4147,"I managed to spy on what Muigin was doing, and he's actually growing the darn things over there!I think the only solution here is to... no, not go talk to him... What are you thinking? The solution is to fight back!We'll need the help of my friend, Marvon, who has a workshop in Ratchet.  I'm sure he'll be able to create some sort of gadget that will help us."
4161,"Long ago, the night elves were called the kaldorei, a name that means ""children of the stars."" Learning of the past is an important step in your path as a <class>, <name>, so listen well to what I have to tell you.The kaldorei have always taken much pride in their harmonious relationship with nature. This means that we only take from nature what is necessary, and that we return in kind. This balance has afforded us much, <name>.Go out and collect seven small spider legs -- no more than that, and return to me."
4181,"Expert engineering yields two distinct disciplines: gnome and goblin.  I only bother to mention goblin engineering because I'm a fair trainer.  They like to make things that blow up, and they rarely care what is in the way - even themselves.<name>, read this manual.  If you want to learn how to blow yourself up, then take it to Nixx Sprocketspring in Gadgetzan.   Remember - membership is permanent and prevents joining the other discipline, so make sure this is what you want before finishing his task."
4182,"Life in the Burning Steppes is rife with conflict.Just look at this place! We know very little of what happened to these buildings, but we do know that at one time, before the great explosion, this was all part of the Redridge mountain range.Enough lamenting! We have a problem, <name>. You may have noticed the dragonkin below this ridge. We need assistance in pushing them back. Kill as many as you can and return to me. Succeed and perhaps we can talk of other things."
4183,"We had always assumed that the Blackrock orcs were a product of their savage upbringing. What we have found here, in their homeland, tells us another story.Indeed, it is bloodlust and thirst for conflict that empowers them, but the black dragonflight are the beings whom control the orcs of Blackrock. We suspect that it is the black dragonflight that fuels them with rage and hostility.Take this letter to Magistrate Solomon. He will know what must be done.<Helendis hands you a sealed letter.>"
4184,"This is grim news, <name>. To discover that our mortal enemies are merely pawns of a much greater threat is disheartening. There is no possible way that Lakeshire could survive an attack from both the Blackrock orcs and the black dragonflight. Should Lakeshire fall to this menace, Darkshire would fall next, and then what? Goldshire? Stormwind itself?You must take this information to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Stormwind at once! If this does not merit the aid of Stormwind, nothing will and all is lost."
4185,"Solomon paints a dreary picture. Still, we cannot afford to send our thinly spread troops to the aid of Lakeshire on speculation. I will need proof of these claims before I can act.Speak with Lady Prestor, <name>. She is a learned woman and knows much of dragons and dragonkin. She may be able to shed some light on this situation."
4186,"I am going to empower you as an acting deputy of Stormwind, <name>.Return to Magistrate Solomon in Lakeshire and deliver this decree."
4201,"Oh, the pains of love!  My dear Private Rocknot is immune to my charms.  I am spurned!  It's maddening!You must help me!  We succubi know much of love, and I can make a potion to beat down the iron walls around Rocknot's heart.  To make it, I need these items: the herb gromsblood, giant silver veins from the cliff giants of Azshara, and water from the Golakka Springs Crater in Un'Goro.  You can place the water in this vial.Please, <name>, help a poor soul in her quest for happiness!"
4223,"<Magistrate Solomon sighs.>You must return to the Burning Steppes, <name>. As a deputy of Stormwind, you will be required to report to Marshal Maxwell. Good luck."
4224,"What? You thought you were the first? How many soldiers must we lose before Stormwind acts?We had accumulated enormous amounts of intelligence pertaining to the Blackrock menace before we lost our commanding officer, Marshal Windsor. With Marshal Windsor went all of our precious information.What we need is that documentation. Speak with Ragged John, <name>. He was with Windsor when they were attacked by a Blackrock raiding party.  He was last seen in a cave to the north."
4241,"So that good for nothing coward says that Windsor is alive, eh?Suit up, deputy, you are going in to find him. If Windsor is alive, you are to bring him back. If he's dead, I want proof.<Maxwell laughs.>I bet you are getting tired of hearing that, aren't you?"
4242,"Bolvar is a fool. I was gathering his precious 'proof' so that I could shove it down his throat.He is a blind buffoon. Proof stands two feet away from him and he does not see.As for my data, it's lost. Gone. Unrecoverable.Should I ever find Ironfoe and make it out of this labyrinth, my first stop will be Stormwind, to place my hammer in between that reptile's eyes.Leave me, <name>."
4243,"Unfortunately, something's happened to one of my greatest inventions. You've seen mechanical squirrels, yes? Well, to get closer to the apes of Un'Goro Crater, I created a mechanical ape to blend in with their kind--I call her A-Me 01.She has scrying gems for eyes so I could see everything she saw. She made it to Fungal Rock--the apes' lair--just east of here, and that's when I lost contact. The last thing I saw was one of their alpha males rushing up to say hello to her!Can you help me find her?"
4244,"A little further investigation shows a panel that slides open. Clearly written above some wiring is the statement, ""Replace Mithril Casing And Turn Power Off Then On.""Taking a moment to replace the panel, you wonder if it'll be that simple to fix A-Me 01 and get her back to Karna Remtravel near Marshall's Refuge.Only trying it will tell."
4245,"Checking to see if you're prepared to lead A-Me 01 back to Karna Remtravel, you flip the switch to the ""Off"" position. Glancing around once again to make sure none of the gorillas are coming, you prepare to see what happens when you flip the switch back to the ""On"" position.This is your last chance... are you sure this is what you want to do?"
4261,"Felwood was once a peaceful and serene land... Until the legion took hold. The infernals, destruction, chaos...The skull of Gul'dan ensured that none were spared here. All fell to the corruption.Even now, as a spirit, I still find myself trapped, bearing the suffering of this land. Help me find my way home. Please, <name>, tell me you will lead an ancient spirit away from here, where I may finally rest.Once I am free, seek out Kayneth Stillwind, a druid that resides in Forest Song, to the east."
4262,"The last five of my mages that went snooping around in Blackrock Mountain came back extra crispy with a permanent orange gnomefro - or worse.<Jalinda picks up some ashes from the ground and releases them into the air.>One nasty bugger in particular, Overmaster Pyron, seems to be causing quite a bit of trouble. We need that elemental terminated so that our expedition crew can make its way into Blackrock Depths!He guards the entrance at the Blackrock Quarry."
4263,"Are you sure Pyron said 'Incendius' when he died?<Jalinda swallows hard.>Lord Incendius is purported to be a minion of Ragnaros! Oh dear, oh dear... whatever will we do?Do you think you can handle another mission? I don't have anybody else to send, <name>!We will never get a team in if Incendius continues to raise Pyron from the ashes.You'll have to find and destroy Lord Incendius!"
4264,"The note has stains covering its surface. The text is barely legible, but you make out the following:...sweet irony......the fall of the broken Alliance......if it were not for General Angerforge's diligence, we may have never discovered the pattern to the encryption......Argelmach is almost done with the decryption of Windsor's notes.Our lord will rise from the depths and crush any that remain...-Emperor Dagran Thaurissan."
4265,"The pod splits opens some when you touch it, revealing a night elven male who is surprisingly still alive.  He seems to be in good health, though deeply stunned.  As you help him down from the pod, he stirs to life.""Thank Elune - you've saved me, friend!  I... I'm Raschal, and I awoke paralyzed inside this pod after these bugs overwhelmed me.  Were you sent by the Stronghold?""It would seem that you've found the missing courier!"
4266,"<name>, General Shandris Feathermoon would like to speak with you personally.  No doubt she wants to thank you for your service to the Stronghold, but I do know that she also wants to talk to you about the insect creatures that you and Raschal faced in southern Feralas.  The reports of those Zukk'ash insects are... frightening, to say the least.General Feathermoon is waiting for you in the main compound."
4267,"I am entrusting you with a copy of the report Raschal made on the infestation of southeastern Feralas.  While the main report is being filed in Darnassus, I want you to give this copy to an associate of the Protectorate.  Her name is Gracina Spiritmight; she is a priestess who dwells in the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus.  She has broad knowledge on these kinds of creatures, and her receiving this report would benefit us all.You're dismissed - good luck, <name>; may Elune watch over us all."
4281,"This parcel of goods you found in the Woodpaw gnoll camps was supposed to be delivered to the small way-station of Thalanaar in southeastern Feralas.  Regardless of the missing courier's fate, the task of delivering the parcel remains unfinished.Examining the parcel in detail reveals a hand written name of ""Falfindel Waywarder"" on the outside of the packaging.  Perhaps this is the parcel's ultimate recipient."
4282,"<Marshal Windsor shakes the note excitedly.>Do you realize what this means, <name>?Perhaps all is not lost! From what I can ascertain, the information is being held by two Dark Iron dwarves: General Angerforge and the golem lord, Argelmach. I have a feeling that they won't just hand over the information if we ask nicely.I hope you are ready to battle.Venture forth and find these two villains! Destroy them and return my lost information."
4283,"I'm going to let you in on a little secret, soldier. Come a little closer.I'M THE ONLY SANE ONE HERE!Look at these people! Would you believe that they're all insane!? Well they are! NUTS! CRAZY!<Oralius lowers his voice.>Let's just keep that between me, you, and my pal Captain Winky.<Oralius grabs at the air and squeezes.>Anyhooooo... I'm collecting badges to go along with my ogre ear collection. Orc is the flavor of the day. Fifty. GO!<Oralius blows into a horn.>SHIP IT!"
4284,"I'm sure you've noticed 'em, <name>. They're everywhere!What am I talking about? Why, the crystals, of course!The crystals... They're all over the crater. Most people ignore them, but I have a strange feeling that they hold power within them. I've been doing experiments here with them for a while, but I can't seem to find anything. Well, I haven't yet, anyway.Say, I'm running a little low on the crystals I have here -- think you might be able to collect some more for me?"
4285,"What could they be for? I can't get the thought out of my head!It's driving me crazy --  that the rumors I have heard about the crystal pylons are all true. Call me gullible, but I'll usually believe anything people tell me.Anyway, I have heard that there is one of the crystal pylons fairly close. Somewhere in the north... Please locate it, <name>. I just know they exist."
4286,"Captain Winky tells me that the Dark Irons in the Depths got all the good stuff. Ain't that right, Winky?<Oralius does his best impersonation of a pirate.>ARRR MATEY! IT BE RIGHT!See what I'm saying? You need to get in there and bring me back some samples of the good stuff.Get in there and shake your moneymaker!"
4287,"During my stay here, I have heard strange rumors about mysterious pylons existing out in the wilderness of the crater, <name>. I guess that they are quite large, with crystals lining their interiors.Although I've never seen one, I can't help but think that the rumors are true -- and that the pylons have something to do with all the crystals we foundSo why don't you help me put my curiosity to rest? Supposedly, there is one in the eastern area of the crater. Do you think you can find it?"
4288,"My experiments so far have not yielded any positive results, <name>. I can't help but hope that you can find a solution by searching for one of the pylons that I have heard exist.Perhaps if we combine certain colors at them... but I get ahead of myself. Let's find them first!<name>, search the western area of the crater; a pylon is said to be somewhere in that area."
4289,"This crater has many strange creatures--they seem to be nobler versions of the creatures found throughout my homeland and beyond. I cannot explain it, but this place cries of the Earth Mother. I pay homage to her every time I track one of her beautiful creatures across its basin.If you too wish to feel the enlightenment that accompanies such a great feat, then head to the north. There you'll find great apes who are a test for any mortal's strength. Bring me their pelts... prove your strength."
4290,"Once, a long time ago, a brother of mine took some meat from one of Lar'korwi's kills. He didn't know it at the time, but Lar'korwi saw him from the forest. Lar'korwi followed my brother for days, destroying everything he touched. My brother, scared, finally decided to run from the Crater and leave Lar'korwi behind.Lar'korwi killed him not far from this spot.If you want to provoke Lar'korwi, find a fresh kill of his and take some of the meat from it.Return to me afterwards."
4291,"I'm actually surprised he has not come for you yet, <name>. But all is well, for I have a final plan that will bring the monster to us.Being the dominant male gives Lar'korwi rights to breed with any female he chooses--and he chooses many of them. You'll find many ravasaur eggs to the west of here. Get close to them and you should provoke an attack by his mates. The females produce an awful smell from a gland in their heads that allow males to know they are ready to breed. Bring me two of those glands."
4292,"This will be the most difficult part because there is some complexity to the plan. To the north of here, you will find a small trail into the mountains. It was here I saw Lar'korwi last. You will know you are in the right area because of all the bones from massive creatures that once wandered nearby. Take the meat you recovered and place it there. Then, rub this mixture I created on the meat. If both lures mingled together do not bring Lar'korwi to you, then I know nothing else that will."
4293,"Felwood is a forest far north of the Barrens, even farther than Ashenvale. There, slimes are found all around pools of water blessed by the touch of Fel. The Scourge decimated the area with attacks of Infernals and other demonic magics--the slimes supposedly crept up through the earth during these attacks.Gather samples of Felwood slimes and we will use the testing equipment next to me to create a control group for our tests against other samples you gather."
4294,"Have you heard of the Un'Goro Crater, <name>? It is near the Tanaris desert, and it is a magnificent place: lush, vibrant, full of creatures and plant life.It is there you must go. Word has reached me that the place seems completely untainted by outside hands. Explorers are just now discovering its secrets.I would like to test the slimes or oozes there. If it is true--that they are uncorrupt--then I would like to see how such creatures have evolved."
4296,"I came to the Burning Steppes, following the legends of the Seven.  They were dwarves of great knowledge and power, and if you have knowledge and power, then wealth is sure to follow.That's what I want.  Wealth!If we can learn more of the Seven, then maybe we can get rich together.  The ruins of Thaurissan is rumored to keep the Tablet of the Seven, which holds knowledge of the ancient dwarves.  Find this tablet, copy its text and bring it to me.  Let's discover its secrets together!"
4297,"Sprite darters are omnivores--that means they eat both meat and vegetation. If your egg here's gonna hatch, we best be prepared. Some good eats for these little guys are flanks of meat, raw and juicy, believe it or not. I was never able to find out why, but it has somethin' to do with Elune's plan for the elves... maybe they were to be protectors or somethin', I don't know.I'll take care of the egg for now, why don't you get me some good Silvermane stalker flanks for 'em to eat when he's hatched."
4298,"Whoa, it was a lot more ready than I thought..."
4300,"Hmm, maybe there be somethin' you can do for the Hand now that me think 'bout it. Yes, Jes'rimon could use your help for sure.In Un'Goro Crater there be raptors with deadly claws. Some of those raptors sometimes have white claws instead of ones black like death. The Hand have... clients... that like weapons crafted from these claws. Bring me many of those white claws, and me pay you good coin. Do it fast enough, and maybe me help you in other ways."
4301,"While you have been exploring Un'Goro, I have seen other things that a mighty hunter such as yourself would relish in. One such sight was a huge ape among the other gorillas to the north. You have been to that cave before, but this time, I wonder if you'll survive the encounter if you accept my task.I call him U'cha, and he is one of the Earth Mother's greatest sons, of that you can be sure. Defeat U'cha and bring me his pelt. Do this, and I will defend your right to call yourself a great hunter."
4321,"The information you have given me about the pylons is very interesting...Give me a moment to do some calculations, <name>. Speak to me again in a moment and I should be able to give you the answer we have been looking for."
4322,"We need to get out of here, <name>. Help me get my gear back from the supply area and free my friends. If we make it out of here, you are to proceed to Morgan's Vigil and speak with Marshal Maxwell. He will give you further instruction."
4324,"Although my little brother Ribbly has been worthless his whole life, I think, finally, he has some value!  But... we might need your help to capitalize on Ribbly's newfound worth.My sister Yuka has been looking for him for weeks, and tracked him to the Burning Steppes.  She sent word to me, asking for some hired hands.So, what do you say?  Want to help?  If so, then speak with my sister.  You'll find her holed up in Flame Crest, a cave northwest of Dreadmaul Rock."
4341,"You have been to the smoldering ruins of Thaurissan? Did you happen to run into a pitiful lout named Kharan Mighthammer? The dwarf that was supposedly watching over my baby girl!<The King sobs.>And now she's gone, <name>!I have had my men turn the Steppes upside down. The only clue they have as to the whereabouts of my daughter is that she may be inside the Depths. For all I know, she could be dead!Kharan is supposedly being held prisoner there... find him! I want answers!"
4342,"Please, hear me out before passing judgement!"
4361,"You must take this information back to King Magni, <name>. He will know what to do!"
4362,"It would seem as if my old adversary, Dagran Thaurissan, has me and the kingdom of Ironforge at his mercy.You may be my last hope, <name>. You must rescue my dear daughter, Moira!There is only one way to make sure that the spell Thaurissan has cast on Moira is broken: Kill him.And <name>, do not harm her! Remember, she is being controlled by Thaurissan! The things she may do or say are a result of Thaurissan's evil spell!"
4363,"Thaurissan was a great and honorable dwarf. You ruined my life and the life of my unborn child!<You think that Princess Bronzebeard may still be suffering from the residual effect of the Emperor's spell.>Return to Ironforge and tell my father that the heir to the Kingdom of Ironforge will be a Dark Iron dwarf.Whether he approves or not, it shall be."
4402,"It sure gets hot out here in the Valley of Trials.<Galgar wipes his brow.>If only I had some cactus apples, I could make my famous cactus apple surprise! Nothing cools you off faster than a piece of that delicious treat.I'll tell you what, <name>. If you bring me 10 cactus apples, I'll make you a few portions of cactus apple surprise to take with you on your adventures. If you're interested, you can find cactus apples growing near the cactus plants around here."
4421,"Not many seek adventure here... Felwood's corruption is widespread and indiscriminate.As part of the Emerald Circle, I seek to heal this land, but there are some that wish it to fester.The ones I speak of are the Jadefire satyrs that dwell to the northwest of here, at the Ruins of Constellas. Led by a particularly cruel satyr named Xavathras, they continue to spread the disease to any creatures they encounter.We must defend this land that was once ours. Defeat Xavathras and destroy his minions."
4441,"The flute you found was carved from an ancient protector, the treant allies that have faithfully protected the night elves.The satyrs have been able to corrupt anything they come in contact with, which includes the ancients that made Felwood their home. By the use of the fel, the spirit of the ancient has been bound and tortured, never completely released. The felbind you found is no doubt related.We must try to purify the flute, <name>. Bring me blessed water from the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus."
4442,"Using the water of Elune, I will attempt to purify the flute. We must end this suffering...May Elune guide my hands and heart.Speak with me again in a moment."
4449,"Hey! Hey, you! Get over here!Ya gotta help me out. I was runnin' from them Dark Iron dwarves, and I hid in here to get out of sight. Damn bastard geologists and their magic ways! They musta seen me hide, cause next thing I knew, they locked the door and stuck me in here.Teach them geologists a lesson! Oh... an' can ya get me some pieces of silk cloth for... for... nothin'."
4450,"Oh, you know what? That reminds me.You wanna finish up a little job I took up while I was in Tanaris? It's easy...Krinkle Goodsteel in Gadgetzan was lookin' for some stuff found here in Searing Gorge and a few other places. Maybe you could take a look at the list and then bring it all to him?I'll just slide his ledger under the door if you're interested. Take that, and the stuff he wants back to him after ya collected it all."
4451,"The small brass key looks simple enough.. The only thing that seems to make it stand out are some words scratched into the head of it:""Dark Iron Outhouse - Do Not Duplicate.""You have no idea what it means or what it will lead to."
4485,"Hello, <name>. I see your dedication remains strong, as does your faith.I think it is time you spoke with Duthorian Rall in Stormwind. There are some more lessons for you to learn, and I feel you are prepared.Seek him out in the Cathedral of Light, and <name>, take these lessons seriously. You've attained your status through humility and hard work, do not disappoint us by becoming arrogant.Be well."
4486,"Well, well, well, look at the mighty paladin in all <his/her> regality.Sorry, <name>, I meant no offense... I just get a little jealous sometimes when I see some of the feats you've accomplished. Tiza tells me it's my weakness, and I swore to her I'd work on it. It's just hard sometimes, you know?But the reason I wanted to talk to you was because Duthorian Rall in Stormwind sent word for you to meet him in the Cathedral of Light when you're ready. Sounded important. Sounded like something's going on."
4487,"Ah, good, you're here. I sent a < succubus/infernal> after you to get your attention, but it seems you were able to get here before it found you. No matter.There has been some talk lately of your growing power--that is good for you, possibly bad for others. But those are irrelevant points. The point is, I feel you've proven yourself and therefore are deserving of... hehe... a blessing of sorts.Above Ratchet in the Barrens you'll find a man named Strahad. I believe you've crossed paths before."
4488,"Ah, <name>, you've seen fit to grace us with your presence. How wonderful!I hope you do not expect us to wait on you hand and foot also. You may be growing quickly in power, but you still are a pup when it comes to true knowledge and understanding. If you're not careful, corruption will overwhelm you and your weak will.But I should get to the point: Strahad wishes to speak to you. He is still residing in his tower overlooking Ratchet in the Barrens. I suggest not taking too long."
4489,"You, <race>! Come here!You're the one they call <name>, yes?I thought as much. I will keep this short: you're growing in power, and it has been acknowledged. And now, the time has come that you are rewarded for your efforts.Go to the Barrens. There, above Ratchet, you'll find Strahad Farsan--perhaps you remember him? He would have words with you. I wouldn't take long."
4490,"I would give you a reward for your patience and hard work. But know this, the ability to summon a Felsteed will be much more difficult in the future. You will have to earn it... and it will not be easy.For now, go with the power to summon such a creature and use it as you see fit."
4491,"Ugh... It's so hot...I was exploring this area, when all of a sudden, the heat just became unbearable. I must be suffering from heat exhaustion.Please, help me get back to my friend Spraggle at Marshal's Refuge. I think I'm well enough to follow you there.I am feeling a little out of it, so if I do happen to faint again, just splash some water on me from Spraggle's canteen. That should work, I hope..."
4492,"You've got to help me, <name>! My friend, Ringo left earlier to explore the volcano to the south of here, and he has been gone way too long. I am really worried about him.Do you think you could find him? Why don't you take my canteen with you -- if you do find Ringo, I'm sure he'll need it!"
4493,"It would seem that the silithid's intent, nay - reason for being, is to devour everything in their path that is not of their ecology.  Their focus is singular, and it is for this reason they are a grave threat to all life on Azeroth.What we've seen to date is but the first stages.  I suspect that their strength comes from deeper in Kalimdor: Un'Goro Crater.  Go to Gadgetzan in the Tanaris desert and speak to Alchemist Pestlezugg.  Tell him of my theory; he will surely aid us in fighting the silithid."

4495,"A friend of mine named Iverron usually visits me at the same time every day. The strange thing is that he hasn't been by today at all -- he's several hours late, in fact.I admit, I am a little worried, <name>. Iverron spends a lot of time over by the cave to the north, and I'm sure you know how dangerous it is there -- spiders, everywhere!If you happen to be going that way, though, will you keep an eye out for him?"
4496,"My research revealed to me that the silithid are like bees; destroy the queen of the hive, and the rest of should be thrown into disarray.  I'll brew a lure that we'll use to bring out the queen; once summoned, you'll take her down.First though, we need some reagents; we don't want you bungling into the jungle unprepared.  Go west to find the silithid hive in Un'Goro Crater and obtain a scent gland from one of the bugs.  I'll also need some samples of the native Un'Goro soil."
4501,"Wanted: A skilled fighter to deal with the threat of the Pterrordax that inhabit the Un'Goro Crater. Their numbers are growing, and they are becoming a menace to travelers in the area.Decrease the population by slaying 10 pterrordax and 15 frenzied pterrordax.Speak with Spraggle Frock after completing the task for a reward."
4502,"Being an apprentice to Marvon Rivetseeker, I've learned so much. But he's been gone for such a long time now, so I think I'm going to work on some experiments of my own.I've been reading about Un'Goro Crater most recently, and about the strange volcanic activity going on in the middle of the crater. I think a lot could be learned if I could just get some of the ash from the elementals there.Do you think you'd mind collecting some for me, if you are going that way?"
4503,"I'm making a flying machine!I got stranded here, and I'm absolutely horrible at finding my way around. I'd take a gryphon or wind rider back to Gadgetzan, but those beasts just scare me to death.So, will you help me? All I have left to build is the wings, and I was thinking that the webby scales from the pterrordax and diemetradon would be perfect. There's no way I'm going to go up against one of those, but you look pretty tough. Why don't you give it a try?"
4504,"I'm always looking for a quick way to earn a gold, <name>. If you help me with my newest idea, I'll let you in on a little of the profit. How does that sound to you?I thought so!Head to the tar pits in northern Un'Goro Crater, and collect me some tar. Not just any tar, now, you'll need to get it from the beasts that live around the tar pits. Regular tar just simply isn't sticky enough.The plant-like creatures contain chlorophyll in their skin, and mixed with the tar, it's super sticky!"
4505,"Some may say that I am exceptionally cruel... But truly, it is only a strong desire to see the Horde gain an advantage against the Alliance, in any way possible.My newest interest is a moonwell at the Ruins of Constellas, south of here, tended by the Jadefire satyrs. The moonwell, once a symbol of renewal for the insufferable night elves, is now corrupted, and used to bring forth more satyrs.I have an idea, <name>, and I'd like a sample of the water... for my little feline friend here."
4506,"This corrupted water can be used to our advantage, <name>. With just a small amount of the water, my kitten doubled in size, and seems to be stronger... somehow. These cats may prove useful...Here, <name>. Take this cat carrier, and release the kitten inside next to the moonwell in the Ruins of Constellas. Heh, heh... I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results!Return the cat to me, and I'm sure I can make it worth your time."
4507,"Here's the lure.  Inside the hive network should be a crystal of some sort.  We think the silithid use the crystal as some sort of hive-wide attunement device.  As for where this crystal might be, I'd say try the hatcheries inside the hive.Using the lure on the crystal should roust out the queen, but be warned - she will probably be protected by several guards.  Take out the queen and remove her brain.  As icky as that sounds, we desperately need to study it.  Good luck, <name>!"
4508,"My recent findings and the knowledge we have gained here today needs to reach hands that can quite possibly do something with it.  As resourceful as we are here in Gadgetzan, we can't do this alone.Take my latest report back to Gracina Spiritmight in Darnassus; she's still at the Temple of the Moon, is she not?  She's got friends who are Alliance bigwigs; if we can get them involved in this <name>, then we just might make it out of this alive."
4509,"My recent findings and the knowledge we have gained here today needs to reach hands that can quite possibly do something with it.  As resourceful as we are here in Gadgetzan, we can't do this alone.Take my latest report back to Zilzibin Drumlore in Orgrimmar; he's still in his place on the upper part of the Drag, is he not?  He's got friends who are high within the Horde; if we can get them involved in this <name>, then we just might make it out of this alive."
4510,"<name>, your help has been immeasurable.  The time will come, no doubt, when I'll ask for your assistance against the silithid once more.  We must absorb what we have learned in Un'Goro; I fear that my assumptions that the silithid originated from Un'Goro are now wrong... that indeed there is a far stronger presence somewhere.Take this note to Idriana at the bank.  She'll give you something from my vault that should be viewed as a token of my gratitude.  Thank you for your assistance, brave <class>."
4511,"<name>, we could not have gotten this far without you.  The time will come soon, no doubt, when I'll ask for your help against the silithid once more.  We must absorb what we have learned in Un'Goro; I fear that my assumptions that the silithid originated from Un'Goro are now wrong... that indeed there is a far stronger presence somewhere.Take this note to Karus at the bank.  He'll give you something from my vault that should be viewed as a token of my gratitude.  Thank you for your assistance, mighty <class>."
4512,"But the thing I've studied most is ooze. I know it sounds odd, but they're all over!I helped a lady in Menethil find her bag not too long ago--it was eaten by oozes. I've seen members of the Royal Apothecary Society from Undercity collecting samples of the stuff. I want to know why! Where does it come from?I've heard of more in Felwood. What I need are samples of the oozes there so I can further my research. I'll give you containers, you use them to collect a sample from the deceased creatures."
4513,"I'm going to need more samples, <name>. But--and I don't know how to put this--they have to be pure samples. I know, I know. ""What does 'pure' mean, Laris?"" I'm not sure. I do know that these are corrupt... just like Felwood. Which is what makes my realization so important. The oozes seem to adapt... to take on the aspects of the area they're in. I'll need to find samples that haven't been polluted. But where? Where?!Bah! <name>, take these containers just in case you find any on your own."
4521,"Winterspring lies just beyond Timbermaw, northeast of Felwood. Have you been there?I have heard that the area is laden with creatures called wildkin. These beasts have been known to guard secrets; secrets of the Night elves.We must figure out what may be hidden in Winterspring.I have heard the ragged owlbeasts can be found just south of the road, and that there are others called raging owlbeasts that may be found in the center of Winterspring. Clear them out, and gain access to the land."
4542,"Brave traveler, the centaurs have increased their attacks in this area. Freewind Post must know about this renewed harassment immediately! Seek Cliffwatcher Longhorn at Freewind Post to the southeast and give him this urgent message.Be warned, avoid the Grimtotem Clan nearby... they have been acting strange toward us lately."
4581,"The druid Kayneth Stillwind sent word to me.  He would like a report of the happenings along our coast and in the forests surrounding Astranaar.  He fears there is a corruption moving through Ashenvale... and he may be right.Here, take my report to him.  You will find him in the shrine of Forest Song, in the Nightsong Woods to the east."
4601,"This contraption stands out amongst the gnomes holding out against the madness outside the room.

Were ye to put a knife to Fleet Master Seahorn, we'd ne'er run afoul of a Booty Bay's vessel.  Were ye to put a knife to Baron Revilgaz, we'd ne'er face the law on their terms."
4641,"Finally, you are of age, <name>... of age to battle in the name of the Horde. To conquer for the glory of the Warchief.Yes...<Kaltunk looks you over.>You will do nicely.No doubt you wish to find a great dragon or demon and strangle it with your bare hands, but perhaps it would be wise to start on something less... dangerous.<Kaltunk laughs.>Report to Gornek, he should be able to assign a task better suited to a young <class>. You will find Gornek in the Den, to the west."
4642,"Here is some encased ooze created from the Felwood samples you recovered. Take the case to Un'Goro Crater and find a pure ooze... the primal variety will do nicely. When you get close enough, release the ooze in the case, and let us see what the two think of one another.After the experiment concludes, bring me a sample of whatever is left over. I will await you here in the Apothecarium."
4681,"That beached creature is not an isolated incident here in Darkshore.  There are more along the coastline and even in the water.  I would like for you to investigate another one that we know of; this one was reported to be in the water due west of Auberdine, close to a sunken vessel.  Return to me with anything that you may recover that would aid our research.Also, in your travels you may find other creatures.  By all means, if you should discover anything then please bring it to our attention!"
4701,"You have no doubt seen the worgs which the Blackrock orcs command.It is curious - no matter how many we destroy, their numbers never dwindle. My scouts have reported that the worgs are bred, trained, and ultimately exported from Blackrock Spire: capital city of the Blackrock orcs. You must travel to Blackrock Spire and discover the source of this menace. Discover... and destroy.Good luck, <name>. May Cenarius protect you..."
4721,"Runners have returned from Winterspring with reports that there is a series of small caves in the southern area of Winterspring. It seems that there are wildkin situated in the area around these caves. If there is something valuable that they are guarding, I believe that this is the place we will find it.You will find these to be more of a challenge than the previous types, <name>. The creatures seem to have gone mad from exposure to the very thing that they strive to protect."
4722,"You find a corpse of a sea turtle that had beached itself on the coast of Darkshore some time ago.  It has been scavenged by the murlocs who have encamped themselves around the creature's remains.  Still, there appear to be some suitable samples left on the creature's remains that Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine might be able to make use of."
4723,"The remains of a giant thresher - much larger than one you'd expect to find in Darkshore - lie beached on the coast of the Mist's Edge.  How this creature came to be here is unknown; the group of murlocs that now feast off the carcass of it seem to be much too weak, even in large numbers, to have brought down the beast.While some of it has been picked clean, enough of it remains to take a sample for Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine to study."
4724,"Some say the worg controlled by the Blackrock orcs are the creation of a supernatural force. Others say they are not true worg but instead a breed of demon dog, granted to the orcs by a fallen pit lord.The truth is far less contrived but every bit as frightening. The worg of Blackrock come from Halycon and her mate. Halycon is the gigantic den mother of the worg. Her mate? Nobody has ever lived to tell the tale of that one.Strike at the heart of the worg. Destroy Halycon... and <name>, watch your back."
4725,"More sea turtle remains lie beached along the coastline.  This particular set has an abandoned carriage attached to the turtle's shell.  Perhaps this creature was driven to the shoreline by unknown beings rather than beaching itself as some of the other remains suggested.  Greymist murlocs now make the remains of this creature their home, feasting off the carrion.In the carriage, you find a box with strange markings on it; perhaps Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine can make sense of it."
4726,"I have been studying the dragonkin of the Burning Steppes for weeks, and I think I've finally had a breakthrough!  I created a device--I call it the Draco Incarcinatrix 900.  It can capture the essence of dragon whelp broodlings!Or, at least I think it can.Here, take the device and zap a broodling in the Burning Steppes with it.  While it's under the device's effects, defeat the broodling and its essence should be released.If it is, then splendid!  Bring me back samples so I can study them!"
4727,"The skeletal remains of a sea turtle lie in the sand of the northern Darkshore beaches.  The Greymist murlocs have either not found this carcass, or perhaps they have and are shying away from it for some unknown reason.  Regardless, there is enough of the turtle left to take a sample back to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine for the Temple of the Moon to study."
4728,"The corpse of what appears to be some sort of giant sea mammal lies partially gutted on the beach.  A wheelbarrow and various tools lie abandoned by this enormous beached sea creature, as though an attempt to study it had been made previously.  Though murlocs have scavenged this beast, enough of it remains to gather a suitable sample for Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine."
4729,"You're probably wondering what I'm doing out here. Look at the cages! Ain't it obvious?I'm an animal lover, first and foremost, but a salesman by trade. I track down exotic animals for the rich and famous and domesticate the beasts so they behave as proper pets.Now you're probably wondering, ""What can I do for you, Kibler."" The answer is simple: Take this here beast cage and find me some worg pups. For that, I'll domesticate a worg for you!"
4730,"The half-devoured corpse of what might have been a giant sea mammal lies on the beach.  A band of murlocs, stronger than those found closer to Auberdine, have taken up residence around the fallen creature.  Enough of the creature remains that a suitable sample of its bones could be delivered to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine."
4731,"Another set of sea turtle remains lie beached on the coastline.  This set of remains has an abandoned carriage half buckled to the turtle's shell.  Perhaps this creature was driven to the shoreline by unknown beings rather than beaching itself as some of the other remains suggested.  Powerful Greymist murlocs have made the carcass of this creature their current home.In the carriage, you find a box with strange markings on it; perhaps Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine can make sense of it."
4732,"You find a corpse of a sea turtle that had beached itself on the coast of Darkshore some time ago.  It has been picked nearly clean by Greymist murlocs, the very ones who now have encamped themselves around the creature's remains.  Still, there appear to be some suitable samples left on the creature's remains that Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine might be able to make use of."
4733,"The remains of what appear to be a giant thresher have washed ashore on the rocky inlet of the Twilight Shore.  The thresher is several times larger than any of the other threshers spotted in these parts.  Wherever it came from, this creature would not seem to have been native to Darkshore.Though the creature has been picked apart in places, enough of it remains to gather a suitable sample for Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine."
4734,"<name>, I've been working hard on a new device, the eggscilloscope!  It's designed to project a burst of cold energy at the egg of a black dragon... and freeze it solid!  Can you test it for me?I heard that high up in Blackrock Spire, the dragons have a rookery where they hatch their eggs.  That's where you'll have to go to test the eggscilloscope, and then let me know how it worked!And don't worry.  Frozen dragon eggs should be harmless.  It's the unfrozen ones you have to worry about!"
4735,"<name>, I'm finally ready for real samples of dragon eggs!  Here, take this collectronic module.  It's designed to extract a dragon egg and prepare it for transport.  Go back to the Rookery and use the module to collect eggs.And don't forget to freeze them first, or they might hatch before you can collect them!When you have enough eggs, bring them to me!"
4736,"Ah, hello, <name>. You're progressing well in your training. So well in fact that I think you should be rewarded for your hard work--and for not becoming corrupted by the arcane yet.If you're interested, seek out Menara Voidrender in Ratchet. She is currently staying at Strahad Farsan's tower overlooking the town.She's not very friendly, <name>, so don't expect any praise. But if you work hard, she'll make sure you're taken care of."
4737,"Hmph, still you strive to become more powerful. I say it's only time before the corruption and addiction takes hold of you and you become a slave to that which you seek to gain power over.Pfah! A fool you are! Time will prove me right--nothing else... just time.But it seems that not all agree with Zevrost. It seems Menara would create tools for you to become more powerful and to harness your strength. If you're interested, then go to Ratchet in the Barrens. She is there overlooking the town."
4738,"Let us be clear about one thing, <name>: I don't feel you are ready for such responsibilities. I don't think aiding in the creation of any item of power is something a novice should ever be involved in; especially one so untested.But that's not my decision. The powers that be, or at least the ones that do wish to impart such gifts upon you get to decide that.If you're interested in learning more, I suggest you seek out Menara Voidrender in Ratchet. She usually resides in the tower above the port town."
4739,"<class>! Yes, you!You don't have all the accoutrements, but it's plain to see you're ready--the air around you exudes greater confidence. Yes, I see it now.Menara Voidrender would teach you a few things if you feel you're ready. She spends her time tutoring younger students in the arcane. She even gives gifts to those who pass her tests.Go to Ratchet in the Barrens if you're interested. She's above the city in Strahad's tower."
4740,"Attention!A reward is being offered for the death of the murloc ""Murkdeep"".  This foul beast is known to be responsible for the death of at least one Sentinel, and is suspected of causing the sinking of at least two cargo vessels in the waters off Darkshore!Murkdeep was last spotted at a hutted murloc camp south of Auberdine, and is thought to be protecting the huts there.  Reward claims for this bounty should be claimed with Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea in Auberdine.The Auberdine Village Council"
4741,"In the northern areas of Winterspring, the Wildkin grow even more ferocious. We must continue our measures there.Hunt the moontouched owlbeasts in Winterspring, and explore the area they inhabit.This is dangerous ground, but I know that you will be able to handle the challenge. Return to me after you have slain 13 of the wildkin."
4742,"As you can see, the unadorned seal has three empty sockets. Each of those sockets must be filled with a gemstone representing the leadership's command. Finally, Overlord Wyrmthalak, master of the lower citadel, must forge the seal in the flames of the Black Dragonflight.Understand this, mortal: the chance that one of the three generals of the lower citadel would carry a gemstone at any given time is rare. You must be vigilant in your quest. Remain determined!"
4743,"Few of the black dragonkin, outside of those in the upper citadel, have the ability to forge the seal with their own flaming breath. Wyrmthalak is one such dragonkin, but his will is unbreakable.You must travel to the Wyrmbog in Dustwallow Marsh. It is there that you will find an ancient drake known as Emberstrife. You must break his will, <name>. Break it and use this orb on his weakened form. You will have scant seconds to control his mind and fan the flames that will forge the seal."
4761,"Your scouting of the furbolg camp is information that Thundris Windweaver should be made aware of.  He graciously serves as the elder of Auberdine, offering sage and just stewardship of the day to day affairs of the village.  Please - share with him your findings to date on the furbolg situation.I believe he has some ideas of his own on the reasons behind their corruption.  Perhaps you can work with him to enact a plan to restore the balance of nature here!"
4762,"The Cliffspring River has begun turning foul and corrupted.  It empties into the Mist's Edge, and I fear the wash will affect Auberdine soon.  I suspect the Blackwood furbolgs up-river are the cause of the taint, but I also suspect that they aren't the true root of it.Take this sampling tube and go to the mouth of the river to our north.  Proceed inland to the first waterfall and draw a sample from the pool there.  You'll see a bridge overhead.  Once you have a sample, return to me in Auberdine."
4763,"We've learned that a source of furbolg corruption is from the satyr.  They hold sway via talismans that they channel magic through.  If the furbolg have a chance at salvation, we must lure out the satyr corruptor and take that talisman!Fill this bowl at our moonwell and take samples of the furbolgs' food from their northern camp.  Mix them and place it near the bonfire by the river; any furbolgs who eat will be cleansed just long enough to lure out the satyr corruptor... who then you must slay!"
4764,"There is a chamber, high in Blackrock Spire, that was once called the Hall of Fortune.  It was where the Dark Iron dwarves kept their relics, trophies and objects of art.That was long ago.  It is said the hall has collapsed and is now used for... less savory tasks.  But I believe some old dwarven relics may still be found there.One such relic is Doomrigger's clasp, with a surface so encrusted with rare gems that it was said to make weep any dwarf who gazes upon it.That clasp, <name>, is your goal."
4765,"I have packaged Doomriggers Clasp into a crate, suitable for shipment to Stormwind.  <name>, you have been extremely helpful -- can I ask you for one last favor?Deliver the crate to Count Remington Ridgewell.  You will find him in the Keep of Stormwind.  I am sure he'll be very pleased to see what you have for him."
4766,"An agent of mine, Mayara Brightwing, was sent to the Burning Steppes to scout the ruined city of Thaurissan.  That destroyed city of the Dark Iron dwarves may hide objects of great value... objects that would fit nicely into our family museum.Mayara says she found something and will need aid in retrieving it, but it is not in Thaurissan.  Instead, a foray into Blackrock Spire will be required.I do not know the details, but if interested then speak with Mayara in the Burning Steppes."
4767,"I've been tasked to recruit more wyverns for the master wind riders. Their numbers are growing and I myself hope to become a wind rider one day. However, we cannot train enough wyverns to keep up with the demand. Perhaps you can help me, <name>.I need you to travel to Highperch to gather some wyvern eggs. From here, head northwest along the canyon walls to a ramp that will lead you into Highperch. Be careful, wyverns are very protective over their eggs and they will not be kind to intruders."
4768,"The Darkstone Tablet holds the writings of the long-dead dwarf Urheld Darkstone.  An alchemist of great skill, he was thought insane by his contemporaries and, hence, did not share his research.But he did etch it onto tablets, and I believe one such tablet lies in Blackrock Spire, in a chamber once named the Hall of Fortune.  I know not what it is now called, for few enter Blackrock and return.But if you are willing to brave its dangers and return to me with the tablet, your reward will be great."
4769,"Vivian Lagrave sent me word from Kargath, in the Badlands.  Through her studies, she believes there is an ancient text within Blackrock Spire that would benefit our research.  To confirm this, she will need someone to extract the text from the spire.  No easy task.If interested, then speak with Vivian in Kargath."
4770,"Please help me, <class>! I've been hiding here in Highperch for some time now and it's been days since I've seen a friendly face. I came here to study the wyvern and I think I got a little too close. After being chased away from one of the nests I got lost.I need to get back to Whitereach Post! Motega does not know that I am missing and will be furious to know that I ventured into Highperch by myself.Whitereach Post is just east of here... please take me there!"
4771,"I've placed Dawn's Gambit in the container you brought to us, the one that held the dragon eggs.  Your job is to bring it deep within the Scholomance.The undead mage Vectus leads a team of scourge scholars... place Dawn's Gambit in their chamber, called the ""viewing room.""  It will then react with the undead found there and, with a little luck, destroy them!After that, defeating Vectus shouldn't be a problem.  Right?"
4781,"Your next task is as simple as your first, but will require you to seek out aid.I require gold thread for the embroidery of the cloak, but gold thread is not easy to come by, and very few know how to make it. Fortunately, one who is loyal to our cause knows its secrets and is willing to help those rising in our ranks.Bring a gold bar to Xizk Goodstitch in Booty Bay. He is a master tailor and will be happy to spin the thread for you. Gold bars are smelted by skilled miners. Ask a miner for help."
4782,"Return to Menara, tell her it'll take some time, but I'll make sure to come through for her... and you. Tell her to have you finish gathering the rest of your components--I should have the thread done by then. You can return and pick it up then.Good luck, <name>. Oh, and say hello to Strahad for me while you're there. That old coot... putting a tower right there next to Ratchet... crazy."
4783,"The next components are found in Desolace, far to the west of the Barrens and even the Stonetalon Mountains.There, chaos still reigns after the Sundering. Both your strength and cunning will be tested there--you will face creatures of hatred and also of the Burning Legion.From the Hatefury satyr in the northeast, bring me their blood. From the lesser infernals in Mannoroc Coven, bring me a lesser infernal stone.We will use both in the construction of your robe."
4784,"I need only three things now, <name>, then we can finish your robe.First, the fine gold thread Xizk is making for you. Return to him in Booty Bay and get it.Second, bring me two smoldering coals from the fire elementals in the Arathi Highlands. If I recall correctly, they are to the west, near Thoradin's Wall.Finally, a soul shard created by you.After you have all the components, return here to the tower and I will complete the robe for you."
4786,I will put the robe together for you now. It will take but a few moments. Do not go far.
4787,"The Prophecy of Mosh'aru speaks of an ancient egg.  It is a relic of a time when trolls ruled vast empires, and it has the power to hold the essence of Hakkar.  It may be the only way to keep our world safe from his evil.Bring me the ancient egg, <name>.  It is said to lay hidden deep within Jintha'Alor in the Hinterlands, in a cave behind the amphitheater at the top of the city."
4788,"While I look over the third and fourth tablets of Mosh'aru, you must find the fifth and sixth!  It will not be easy, for they are held by the Smolderthorn trolls within Blackrock Spire.  The spire is a dark mountain of fire between the Burning Steppes and the Searing Gorge.Good luck, <name>.  Blackrock Spire is no place for decent folk..."
4808,"I have another favor to ask of you.My initial study of the essence you collected shows that it might be possible to freeze dragon whelp eggs and preserve them!  I want to test this theory, but first I need specially made engineering components.  My colleague, Felnok Steelspring, can make them.Here, take this letter to Felnok.  It tells him what I need.  You'll find Felnok in Winterspring, in the town of Everlook."
4809,"I have most of what Tinkee needs, but I'm missing one important component, and that's chillwind horns.  The horns of the chillwind chimaera in Winterspring are a concentrated source of cold, but only pristine, uncracked horns will do!  I'll need a supply of those to complete Tinkee's order.Bring me the uncracked chillwind horns, and I'll prepare a package for Tinkee."
4810,"Ok, everything is prepared and packed and ready for transport!  Good luck in your journey, and make sure you tell Tinkee that she owes me!"
4811,"Hostile moonkin roam in ever increasing numbers to our east.  They once were thought to be gentle, almost mystical creatures.  While some continue to hold reverence for them, the safety of Auberdine forces me to keep a more realistic view.I've received reports that moonkin are being drawn to a large red crystal along Darkshore's eastern mountain range.  No one has any idea what that crystal is, or even if it really exists.  I want you to locate it over there and report back to me what you find."
4812,"Use this empty vial and fill up on some moonwell water here in Auberdine.  Such potent magic should provide a clue as to the composition of the crystal.  To do that, you'll pour the liquid over the crystal; it should take care of the rest.While I don't anticipate anything bad happening to you, I still want you to be careful.  Above us to the east is Felwood; if that crystal is tied to that place as I suspect it is, then it could prove to be very dangerous."
4813,"The moonwell water has revealed that embedded inside the crystal are a few small fragments of bone, as well as half of a jawbone.  The jawbone appears to be from a humanoid, but it is unclear without breaking open the crystal - a feat that even the strongest of magic would find near impossible.With the task at hand complete, all that remains is to report back to Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea in Auberdine."
4821,"A rumor has surfaced about an alien egg here in Thousand Needles. Those that report seeing this egg have failed to even get close enough to examine it in detail. Serpents guard the egg as if it's one of their own.I want you to seek out this alien egg and bring it to me so that I may examine it. Reports say the egg is located within a serpent den, but there are several serpent dens along the base of the cliff walls south and northeast of Freewind Post."
4822,"ICE CREAM!  Oh please please please could you get me some ice cream?!  Strawberry is my favorite flavor, and there's no better strawberry ice cream in the world than Tigule and Foror's Strawberry Ice Cream!  It's my favorite ice cream in the whole wide world!I had it once a long time ago when I was at the Shimmering Flats race track, but I heard that they might be selling them in town now!  Please?  Pretty please?  With Tigule and Foror's Strawberry Ice Cream on top??!?!"
4841,"<name>, I entreat you to hunt these centaur down. They shall feel the wrath of our revenge. Attack the centaur camp to the north of Freewind Post!  Let wrath guide your hand!"
4842,"To tell you the truth, although there are no volcanoes here in Winterspring, I believe that there are far more threatening reasons for these hot springs...Well, I think you'll want to see it for yourself. You'll need to travel the length of Winterspring, and head to the very south. When the air becomes thick and muggy, and the sky turns dark, you'll have found what I believe to be the source of the hot springs.Have a look. I'm sure you'll have many questions when you return."
4861,"Hey there, <lad/lass>! I was chased from my camp in southern Winterspring by some bloodthirsty wildkin! Well, I suppose I got too close to something the wildkin were guarding.I barely managed to get away safely; I fear a buddy of mine wasn't as lucky. Would you mind braving the wildkin and heading to the camp? I really need my supplies, and I'd also like to get back the amulet I unearthed yesterday at the dig site."
4862,"Believe it or not, there are people out there willing to pay for the most vile of domesticated beast!I'd sent Bijou into the Spire to try and collect some of those spire spider eggs but I haven't heard from her in weeks. Maybe you can help me out?I'll tell you what, <name>. Go to Blackrock Spire and collect some spire spider eggs for me. Bring them back here and not only will I give you a little cash, but I'll even domesticate one for you!"
4863,"Looking around, you don't see much that Jaron could want here. However, you do notice that the crate you found has been smashed open, almost as if this was what the wildkin were after...Looking to the east, you can barely make out an abandoned wagon. Perhaps you might find Jaron's things there. It's worth a look."
4864,"After inspecting the contents of the box, you decide that Jaron could make use of the tools and other items inside. However, there is no sign of the amulet.It appears that the wildkin inhabit the lands to the north and east of here, so you decide that the next step is to face the creatures and reclaim the amulet from them."
4865,"If I did not see that with my own eyes I would never have believed it to be true. Vengeance has come to Thousand Needles!<Hagar wipes his brow.><name>, you must act quickly! Go now and seek out Motega Firemane; he is located at Whitereach Post just northwest of Freewind Post along the road. He will know what to do!"
4866,"It's probably one of the most potent poisons in the world, <race>!I've overheard the Blackrock speaking about its lethality in my jaunts into the Spire. They call it 'Mother's Milk', named after Mother Smolderweb, the big nasty spider in the Skitterweb cave.Now here's what I need from you: A live sample of the Milk, flowing through YOUR veins. Just bringing me the gland won't be enough! Get her to poison you and come back to me!Then... I get to milk ya!<Rubs his hands together in anticipation.>"
4867,Argh!  So hard to speak!Take this note!  Get me my mojo!
4881,"The Tauren, Kanati Greycloud is bold to set up a hunting camp in Thousand Needles. We must kill him to rid this hunting camp and all who may follow him. We will converge at the small post Southwest of the Great Lift."
4882,"You are unsure of the significance of the necklace that fell from the neck of the recently-slain wildkin. It glows brightly, slowly fading in and out.Trull Failbane might be able to tell you more, since his knowledge of the wildkin seems extensive. Perhaps you should ask him about it."
4883,"While I do possess much knowledge about the owlbeasts you defeated in Winterspring, I am not very learned on the subject of the magics they wield. But I do believe I know of one that would be able to examine the necklace and most likely tell you what it is.Nara Wildmane in Thunder Bluff is an expert in this field; see her. Good luck, <name>."
4901,"At the very top of the ridge lies what I believe to be an altar of the goddess Elune. From what I can tell, we need to light the five torches in each cave, and then we will be able to access the altar directly.I transcribed some incantations carved into the stone in the ancient ruins of Kel'Theril, which I believe are the secret to unlocking the altar. I'll need your help to light each torch, while I recite the spell.If we are successful, you'll be able to report our findings to Erelas!"
4902,"That's fascinating!I have always wondered about the truth... Well, you must share this knowledge, definitely! Go to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm right away -- you'll find him in Darnassus, in the Cenarion Circle. Explain to him what happened, just the same as you told me. I'm sure he will be just as interested!This is important information, <name>!"
4903,"By order of Warlord Goretooth, the following inhabitants of Blackrock Spire must be destroyed:"
4904,"Arnak thinks we're going to be married... but after I declined his offer he came back that night and kidnapped me. My brother tried to stop him, but Arnak was too strong. He... he slew my brother and then brought me here.  My poor brother...<name>, could you escort me out of the Darkcloud Pinnacle?  Please... I need to get back to Thalia! She must be worried sick about me."
4906,"A second encampment of satyrs threatens the land of Felwood towards the north, led by the cruel Xavaric. The vile betrayers and tricksters feed upon the corruption of the native creatures of Felwood.Xavathras and his minions were only part of a larger plan -- to cultivate a corrupted moonwell, and then provide the spoils to Xavaric.Now that Xavathras is out of the way, finish this task, <name>. Head to the north and defeat Xavaric."
4907,"Hi, <name>.  Remember Tinkee Steamboil?  Well, she remembers you!  She sent me a message to keep an eye out for you, because... she needs your help again.  I think it has something to do with her studies on dragons.You should speak to her in the Burning Steppes, at the Flame Crest."
4921,"We battled in a small tauren camp when we were separated--she held three of the Bristlebacks off by herself. But the odds began to overwhelm us. I led some away only to see her overwhelmed by newcomers. In my rage, I turned to face my enemies, but they brought me down easily with their vast numbers.I awoke to a tauren druid tending my wounds--he had come across me on the Gold Road as I fell.Please, <class>, find some sign of my wife."
4941,"Rend lives?Impossible!It had been thought that Rend  was slain decades ago.Seek out the wisdom of Eitrigg, <name>. None know the workings of the Blackrock better than he and if what is written here bares truth, Eitrigg should be informed. No person should be denied the right of vengeance.You will find him in Orgrimmar.Once you have spoken with Eitrigg, confer with the Warchief to find out what he wishes to do about this problem."
4961,"Ah, a summoner's orb--this is where the taint must be coming from. We must exorcise the demon within it if you're to use it. That I can do easily.You're the one who has the hard job.  You must kill the demon once I release it.And you'll have to be quick.  If you take too long then he'll return to the orb and we'll have to start over!So get yourself ready, <name>.  Prepare your strongest spells and keep your potions handy, and go get a friend if you have one.  Because this isn't going to be pretty."
4962,"So, you have chosen to capture the soul of a felhound, good.Take this ruby--with it, you will be able to capture the creature's soul. It works very similar to spells you already know: when the creature is close to dying, use the gem and it should do the rest of the work for you.I would suggest going to Desolace and trying your hand at any of the felhounds there. Those should do nicely.After you're successful, take both the captured spirit and your ruby to Menara."
4963,"So, you have chosen to capture the soul of an infernal, good.Take this emerald--with it, you will be able to capture the creature's soul. It works very similar to spells you already know: when the creature is close to dying, use the gem and it should do the rest of the work for you.I would suggest going to Desolace and trying your hand at any of the infernals there. Those should do nicely.After you're successful, take both the captured spirit and your emerald to Menara."
4964,"I will get started immediately on crafting your orb and infusing your new demon into it. When done, you will have the choice of having it in the form of a staff or orb. I always felt it was important to cater to a warlock's chosen weapon... I see no reason not to continue that practice."
4965,"Well, well, well... a pleasure to see you're growing in power, <name>. I'd wager you'd be about ready to speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. If you haven't spoken to her before, then let me tell you, I don't think I've ever met another expert in the creation of items--orbs specifically--that can inprison even a demon to serve our will so easily.If you're interested, she's in Strahad's tower above Ratchet in the Barrens."
4966,"But, there may be more centaur than I thought, I ask you, <name>, to fight with me against these vile assassins."
4967,"Still a fool, and still seeking the trappings of mortals. Yes, I speak to you with arrogance. I see you before me and I laugh. You're pathetic!But it matters not what I think. It only matters what those willing to deal with you thinks!  And in this case, against my better judgment, those with some portion of power feel you deserve more.If this is something you strive for then you should speak with Menara Voidrender in the tower above Ratchet. I believe you have met her before some time ago."
4968,"Hmm, you've made it this far... truly astonishing. I would have thought the corruption of channeling the arcane would have seeped into your very soul and driven you mad by now. How about we try and push you further then?If you want to test your skill, seek out Menara Voidrender above Ratchet in Strahad's tower. She will guide you."
4969,"Haha! You're doing very well for yourself, young <class>.Given time, infernals and dreadlords will bow before you!But until that time comes, you must still rely on weapons forged by the hands of the mortal races.You seem prepared for another such creation, and if you are willing, Menara Voidrender would speak with you! She is near Strahad's tower overlooking the port town of Ratchet. Go there when you are ready."
4970,"If you wish to prove yourself, you may begin by doing a very simple, but very important task.Gather meat from the chimaera and from the shardtooth bears in the area. Bring it to me so that I may use it to feed the frostsabers that are being trained."
4971,"Tampering of the timeline by a sinister force - most likely the Scourge - has occurred in Andorhal!  I can try to keep the passage of time here intact and mend what has been damaged, but I'll need your help to do so uninterrupted.Temporal parasites - carrion that feed on the strands of time's altered flow - now infest the silos of Andorhal.  A blue pulse of distortion is their only visual marker.  They slow my auguries; please <name>, help me by using this temporal displacer to root out these parasites."
4972,"I need you to reach into the world beyond this room, <name>.  Allow me to explain.You see the difference in this room compared to the rest of Andorhal.  My dragonflight works in many different ways and in many different timelines.  To mend Andorhal's damage, I now act from a different timeline as not to overly contaminate it.  To continue this though I need time trinkets, ones trapped from when the plague hit.  Find them in lockboxes found in the ruined buildings that make up this once proud city."
4973,"If you are willing to help once more, I can certainly use your assistance.  I'll gladly take more watches you might uncover from the ruins of Andorhal.  They certainly help me in maintaining a balance against whatever malign force is meddling with the timeline here.In exchange for those watches, I'll give you another item that, in the future, I suspect you'll find quite the use for."
4974,"Rend dares make such grand claims because of the protection he is afforded by the black flight.You, <name>, will find a way to pass through the Halls of Ascension. You will then find 'Warchief' Rend Blackhand and you will destroy him - FOR THE HORDE!<Thrall slams a fist down upon his throne.>The next time you return to my chambers, you will hold his head high in triumph and then you shall present it to your Warchief. Do this and be honored as a hero of the Horde."
4975,"I will get started immediately on crafting your orb and infusing your new demon into it. When done, you will have the choice of having it in the form of a staff or orb. I always felt it was important to cater to a warlock's chosen weapon... I see no reason not to continue that practice."
4976,"Take the cleansed orb back to Menara in Ratchet, <name>. Give her my regards and be safe. I truly hope you are able to withstand the temptation and corruption that is sure to come as you follow your path.Good luck."
4981,"Never trust a goblin. That's what it comes down to, <name>.Bijou is her name - one of our slipperiest operatives. I found out she was working for some shady exotic pet dealer out of the Burning Steppes named Kibler, in essence, two timing us. Worse yet, she was using Horde funds to finance her operations.I want her brought back here alive.She was last seen entering Blackrock Spire. Find her and bring her back.And <name>, do not let her sweet talk you."
4982,"At night when this place is lightly guarded, I sneak around the city, taking notes and writing down anything I see that could be of some strategic value to the K.E.F.Last night, however, things went dreadfully wrong. I stumbled across a tripwire and set off an alarm. I stashed my recon gear and ran for cover! Unfortunately, I can't get back to that gear. They've doubled and tripled up the patrols! All that information is lost.Get my belongings back and I'll return to the K.E.F. peacefully."
4983,"Take this report back to Lexlort. It will redeem my good name and will surely give the K.E.F. a strategic advantage in dealing with these orcs.Come with you? I've got way too much work to do. Get going, they need these reports as soon as possible!"
4984,"While there was little I could do alone to thwart the Scourge, I nevertheless came to these lands to try and heal the damage done to nature.  Animals suffer from the plague that continues to choke these lands, unable to find mercy and peace.  I ask for you to continue what I could not finish here.There is no salvation for the suffering animals but a sweet and merciful release.  Seek out diseased wolves nearby and put them down.  Please <name>, end their misery - doing so will surely soothe mine."
4985,"To the east of where we are, near where the Eastern Plaguelands begin, once proud and majestic grizzlies roamed the countryside.  The plague released by the Scourge has sundered these beasts too.  They wander the countryside, agonized by the stiffening of their muscles and the rotting of their fur and flesh.I ask of you to end their misery as well.  The only cure for their suffering is a swift death, one that must be ministered by your hand."
4986,"The lifeless hand of the tauren druid clutches a surprisingly healthy looking oaken branch.  Examining the branch reveals glyphs of a druidic nature carved into the bark.As you grasp the branch, you notice it is warm to the touch, more than it should be.  The image of the Teldrassil tree enters your mind - Darnassus specifically - and the words ""Cenarion Circle"" are on the tip of your tongue.  It would appear that the suggestion of where to take the branch has been placed within it."

5001,"Ordinarily I don't deal with <race>s but it seems that I'm stuck between a troll and a hard place. You see, my mission here is one of utmost importance to the Horde. The information I've discovered, however, applies to the well being of the Alliance as well. Now believe me, I'm no Alliance sympathizer, but the Blackrock threat is bigger than just a bunch of orcs.You help me out by finding my belongings and I'll help you out with some information that could prove useful to your kind.Deal?"
5002,"I'm a goblin of my word, <race>. Now listen closely:These orcs are used primarily as beasts of burden and cannon fodder for the black dragonflight!Their true leader is none other than Nefarian, brood of Deathwing. I've also discovered the location of Nefarian's subordinates in this part of the citadel.Take this map to Marshal Maxwell in the Burning Steppes. It has the location of these fiends marked for easy identification."
5021,"""The package must be delivered... delivered before I'm trapped here!""The cries of a panicked woman feel almost like a whisper floating through the house.  Cowered in the upstairs corner is the apparition of a woman.  She does not seem to be fully cognizant of her surroundings, and she is only vaguely aware of you.""Are you here to deliver my package?  Please, before it gets much worse!  I was going to ride out of here.  It should still be by my horse... or am I too late?"""
5022,"You pick up the package, wiping off a small layer of dust and grime that had settled on it.  It is addressed in a hurried hand to an Emma Felstone of Stormwind; the delivery of the package is dated for well over four years ago.Though it is unclear if Emma Felstone is even alive, it is widely known that the Stormwind City Hall keep records on the populace of the city.  This is handled through the Royal Factors of the Stormwind Census."
5023,"You pick up the package, wiping off a small layer of dust and grime that had settled on it.  It is addressed in a hurried hand to a Jeremiah Felstone of Lordaeron; the delivery of the package is dated for well over four years ago.Though it is unclear if Jeremiah Felstone is even alive, it is widely known that the Undercity, formerly known as Lordaeron, keeps records on the populace of the city.  This is handled through the Royal Overseers of the Undercity Census."
5041,"That attack on the caravan contained supplies we desperately needed.You've been brave enough to take on the Razormane tribe so far, and I will ask you to do so again, but this time, I wonder if I could ask you to keep your eyes open for some of our lost supplies. You can probably find them throughout their camps, the quilboar getting fat off their dishonorable acts.The people of the Crossroads would be in your debt."
5047,"You'll find Malyfous Darkhammer in Everlook, <class>. Tell him that 'Finkle is A-OK' and that the suit works perfectly.Then hand him this:<Finkle hands you a glowing piece of flesh.>I snatched it from the beast's innards during my 'vacation.'I bet Malyfous could give you a fairly accurate assessment of what he can do with parts from a monster like this!Oh, I suppose you don't know where Everlook is, do you? To Winterspring, < fella/lady>!"
5048,"She's a tad ornery, and quite possibly out of her gourd... but the records indicate that Ol' Emma does fit the framework of who Emma Felstone might be.Perhaps you've seen Ol' Emma wander the city - she talks to herself, most often in nonsensical jibber-jabber.  Still, she doesn't hurt anything or anyone, so folks pretty much leave her be.All things considered, I would say that Ol' Emma is in fact Emma Felstone.  You might try asking if her last name is indeed Felstone."
5049,"From the evidence I am able to muster, the person you seek - and the intended recipient of the parcel - is Jeremiah Payson, the Undercity cockroach vendor.I've always been of the opinion that it takes a special gift to sell... cockroaches.  No doubt you are on quite the epic sojourn now, mighty <class>.  I will leave you to your world-shaping endeavors.  Allow me, however, to be a part of your magnum opus and reveal that he is located near the bank, suitably groveling under one of the walkways."
5050,"It would seem that I was wrong about you <name>, and for that I owe you an apology.  My sister sent me a number of personal effects, including humorously enough the deed to the Felstone farm.  I think I'll pass on reclaiming it right now."
5051,"The ramblings of the poor ghost continue:""I'm so cold, John.  Bring me your charm, and we'll be together!  Quickly John, before the plague comes to change us into hideous beasts!  I can't see you John... but I know you're near.  I feel you near me.""Perhaps if the second half of the charm was found and reassembled, this would constitute what the spirit of Janice Felstone is seeking."
5052,"Along with the thorns, the blood affected <snort> other aspects of the earth: blood red stones mixed in with other minerals. The Bristleback dig up these shards and carry them as totems <snort> for strength in battle and as totems for their magics. <snort>I know the secrets of that magic.Bring Mangletooth one of these blood shards to show you understand. Bring Mangletooth many of the shards, and he will bless you with quilboar magic--the magic of Agamaggan! <snort>"
5054,"In the snowy mountains of Winterspring, to the northwest, a skilled hunter stalks his prey... I speak of Ursius of the shardtooth bears, an agile and clever beast.I send you now against him. He roams the sloping hills to the northwest of Everlook. Find and hunt him, before he discovers your intent.All that have gone up against Ursius have quickly found themselves to be the prey, and he, the hunter. Stay on your guard."
5055,"Swift, and clever, Brumeran glides silently across the snowy landscape of southern Winterspring. But do not let her graceful appearance convince you that she is harmless. All that cross her pay considerably, and often with their own lives.Seek out Brumeran of the chillwind among the chimera. Defeat her, then return again to me."
5056,"In northern Winterspring, great cats assemble around a large landmark called Frostsaber Rock. The leader of these cats is known by the name Shy-Rotam. Defeating the matriarch of the frostsabers would grant you much respect in the eyes of your fellow <race>.Go again to the harsh wilds, and once there, gather sacred meat from the frostsabers. Find the stone of Shy-Rotam, and place it there. Placing the meat of her kin before her will summon Shy-Rotam, in anger.Be ready for her fury, and defeat her."
5057,"Before you spoke to me, <name>, I had heard of your endeavors... that you had an unyielding desire to prove yourself, that you had an exceptional ability as a <class>, and I now know these things to be the truth.Those that excel as you do are worthy of recognition. Take this marker to a friend of mine in Thunder Bluff named Melor Stonehoof. I'm sure he will remember you, and what you accomplished so long ago. Speak to him of you recent victories, and do not ever forget what you have accomplished today."
5061,"You have completed the necessary lessons all young druids are taught before they can adopt an aquatic aspect.  Go now back to your trainer, Mathrengyl Bearwalker, in Darnassus.  Show him your pendant and prove to him you are ready to learn what he has to teach you.  He will complete your training, allowing you to become one with the water.Goodbye, young druid.  We shall speak again."
5062,"Arikara is a deadly creature that must be dealt with swiftly. In order to hunt her down you will need to light the sacred fire of life - this will summon Arikara.Go now and harvest the rare Incendia agave plant. Once you have harvested enough agave, seek council with Magatha Grimtotem on Elder Rise in Thunder Bluff. She is a powerful shaman that can enchant the agave plant to create a powder that will light the fire.Travel northeast to the Boiling Pool and gather Incendia Agave."
5063,"A finer cap you may never see. From the pristine hide of the beast, our expert crafters will create the most phenomenal hat a prestidigitator could ever hope to don!Fifty gold pieces along with the listed items and your head shall be graced with the Cap of the Scarlet Savant:*The pristine hide of the Beast.*Frayed abomination stitchings.*Arcane crystals.*Enchanted scarlet thread.BEHOLD!"
5064,"<name>, you have served us well in the past, so I now entrust to you an important mission. The Grimtotem Clan is up to something secretive. Three agents of unknown origin were seen visiting the Grimtotem over the recent weeks. We discovered that separate chests in Darkcloud Pinnacle hold these guarded messages.<name>, if you succeed in this dangerous mission, I will reward you in kind."
5065,"The troll with whom you spoke did not tell the truth.  The two tablets you gained for him spoke of containing the essence of Hakkar, but there is more to that legend.  I have studied long, and found that there are six Tablets of Mosh'aru, not two!  Six!And I fear that we will not like what secrets the others hold..Find the third and fourth tablets of Mosh'aru.  They're in the Eastern Plaguelands, held by the mossflayer trolls. Find them, and bring them to me."
5066,"Hear ye, hear ye!  All heroes are called upon to heed these words!A call to arms has been issued by the Kingdom of Stormwind!  All able bodied individuals are entreated to take up arms against the dark threat of the Scourge in the northern lands of the Eastern Kingdoms!  Rumors fly of new threats rising from the ruins of the Plaguelands!Heroes of the realm - seek out Commander Ashlam Valorfist who has set up his base camp in Chillwind Camp, north of the Alterac Mountains!"
5067,"While the crafting of such an item has never successfully been accomplished, it is thought to be possible - under the right circumstance.Should the seeker of arcanum desire to imbue leggings with immense power, the following they must find:* The pristine hide of the Beast.* Frayed abomination stitchings.*Arcanite Bars.*Frostwhisper's embalming fluid.BEHOLD!"
5068,"It is said that only one Breastplate of Bloodthirst has ever been created and that it was made for the legendary assassin, Garona. Whether this world will ever see another is doubtful.Regardless! Our master crafters can reproduce the item given the necessary components:*The pristine hide of the Beast.*Frayed abomination stitchings.*Arcanite bars.*The skin of shadow.BEHOLD!"
5081,"This information fills in the gaps to our otherwise impeccable intelligence of Blackrock Spire.The attack must be decisive, <name>.First their war master, the troll Voone, must be destroyed. Without his battle plans, the Blackrock orcs will be thrown into chaos.You must then take out the ogre Highlord, Omokk. The cowardly ogres of Blackrock are powerless without his leadership.Lastly, the overlord of the citadel: Wyrmthalak. With Wyrmthalak dead, their central command unit is without a conduit."
5082,"I came to Winterspring to investigate the Frostfire Hot Springs. I've noticed that the water seems to have ...strange qualities. I haven't yet been able to discover the source, and to tell you the truth, I've had some difficulty lately, due to the Winterfall furbolg.They seem to be drawn to the springs, just as I am. They have become extremely protective of the water, and won't let me come near the two larger springs to the north of here.I'd like to continue my studies, so won't you help me?"
5083,"This vial that you picked up from the Winterfall furbolg is empty, but you can detect a few drops of a strange green liquid inside; it almost glows.Is it something important?Donova Snowden would probably be able to tell you more, since she has been camped by the hot springs in Winterspring for some time now."
5084,"This greenish liquid... it reminds me a bit of the sludge I saw when traveling through Felwood. And I have seen some Winterfall Runners passing into Timbermaw... Perhaps these things have something to do with the flask you found, <name>.There is a large group of furbolg just past Timbermaw Hold, in Felwood. Called the Deadwood tribe, they have been corrupted and driven mad by the fel. Why don't you look around there and see if you can find any evidence of dealings between the Winterfall and the Deadwood?"
5085,"The greenish substance inside the cauldron appears to be similar to what you found in the flask. This strange gooey stuff could be as corrupted as the furbolg that created it...If the Winterfall furbolg are using it, does this mean that they will soon be as corrupted as the Deadwood tribe?It would be best to report back to Donova with your findings, along with a sample of the liquid in the cauldron."
5086,"I've studied the sample you returned with, and while I can't say for sure, I believe it contains traces of toxic elements. However, the only way to know for sure is to gather some as a comparison.I believe that the Deadwood furbolg may be gathering these elements from other corrupted creatures in Felwood; in particular, the elementals living in the Irontree Woods, called toxic horrors.Collect a few samples for me to compare, but be careful -- it's very dangerous there!"
5087,"Very interesting, <name>...When this toxic substance is mixed with the water from the hot springs, it loses its toxicity, only retaining the ability to temporarily affect those that ingest it. This must be why the Winterfall protect the hot springs so fervently -- they need them to purify their firewater.We need to stop this -- cut off contact between the Winterfall and the Deadwood. A group of runners walks the distance between their village and Felwood. Find and defeat them, and steal their shipment."
5088,"Take this refined and purified Incendia powder to Thousand Needles and toss it on the sacred fire of life. It is located in the Darkcloud Pinnacle on an isolated needle where they bury their dead.The enchantment that I have weaved into the Incendia powder will summon Arikara to you, <name>.I fear she may be stalking Cairne Bloodhoof; too much Tauren lore has changed, and I fear this has angered Arikara. Move quickly before all is lost, <class>!"
5089,"From the corpse of the defeated serpent you uncover what appears to be a note of some importance: A letter from his superior, General Drakkisath, concerning protocol.Your instinct tells you that you should take it to Marshal Maxwell."

The Scourge relies on the buffer of undead that infests Sorrow Hill as a first line of defense.  If we are to advance on Andorhal, we will need to do it through Sorrow Hill.Your first assignment will be to clear the way through Sorrow Hill.  Thin out the skeletons and ghouls that haunt the area; report back to me when this is done!"

5096,"Before Andorhal, we must tackle the advancing Scarlet Crusade menace from Hearthglen.  They've made camp between Felstone Field and Dalson's Tears, making us risk conflict against both the Scourge and the Crusade at once.My plan is to play them off of each other by sending you to destroy the command tent they've set up; use some Flame in a Bottle from this box of incendiaries.  Once razed, plant this Scourge banner by the tent.  With some luck, they'll ignore us and focus on the Scourge for vengeance."
5097,"Through the use of a magical device known as a beacon torch, we can mark targets of our choosing for future actions by our troops.  To that end, we think the Scourge are using Andorhal's watchtowers as a means to control their troop movements.Your mission: breach Andorhal's defenses to plant beacons at all four watchtowers.  You'll need to be in the doorway of each tower to plant the beacon; it will then proceed to mark the tower.  There are only five charges on the beacon torch, so use them wisely!"

We must be vigilant, <name>. None should be spared our wrath as none of our own were spared when they struck at our homes and families.Find this General Drakkisath and destroy him!The task certainly will not be a simple one, but the rewards shall be extravagant."
5103,The only thing that remains of this human are some charred bones. He seems to have died within arms reach of what he was after - unfired plate gauntlets.Perhaps you should grab the gauntlets and get out of the fire?
5121,"While we still know very little about why the furbolg have been ingesting this strange substance, I do think it's best that we put a stop to it before it gets out of hand.The Winterfall furbolg are not a normally aggressive tribe, and this change in their behavior leads me to think that they must be under orders from their chief. We most likely can't undo the damage that has already been done, but I think that if their leader is slain, they will not get any worse.Head east to Winterfall Village."
5123,"The log you found on the high chief looks extensive, but after looking through a couple of the pages, you find that you cannot read the text. The markings are so crude and poorly-formed that you are not sure if anyone would be able to read them.But perhaps Donova will be able to tell you what it says..."
5124,"By Thaurissan's beard!Where did you find them?More importantly, are you willing to part with them? Naturally, I would pay you for such a noble gesture.I'll tell you what, <name>. If you give me those unfired gauntlets, I will teach you how to make a set all your own. All you need to do is collect the parts for me so that I may narrow down the exact recipe.Do we have a deal??Here's the list of what I need, I'll front the non-enchanted thorium myself since you're supplying the gauntlets."
5126,The Satyr paces about and talks to himself. Do you wish to question him?
5127,"Lorax makes deals, he does not accept them from insignificant mortals.A deal I shall make with you, however... take this pike, it is imbued with powerful Fel energies. When you find Goraluk Anvilcrack, slay him and drive this pike through his dying heart. His soul he bartered, his soul I shall have. Return the pike and return the breastplate that the thief stole and I shall teach you what it is that he was to learn."
5128,"The Winterfall are no longer a threat to me, but if you still want to find out what was driving the furbolg to create and consume this strange firewater, I think you should seek out Kelek Skykeeper.He is part of a group known as the Emerald Circle, druids that are committed to their work in Felwood, healing the land from the corruption.Kelek has much experience with the furbolgs in Felwood, and may be able to tell you more about the log.Thank you, again, <name>."

First, are there still entropic elementals roaming the area? And second, are the craters still filled with the corrupt, fetid water that gathered there years ago? Will you help me and check, <name>? Be careful though, the infernals destroy anything in their path."
5157,"Deep within Jaedenar lies Shadow Hold--the main fortress of their corruption and evil.The Shadow Council has protective spells surrounding their lair in the form of braziers.

Hold one of my scales and stand upon a rune and you shall be transported to Haleh, our matron protectorate.Give her the scale so that she may scry what it is I have seen and felt, here in this doomed place."
5161,"We understand what the cursed brood of Deathwing attempts to do and we know that it cannot be allowed.Because of the protection Blackrock mountain affords Nefarian, it has become increasingly difficult for us to intercede.We can, however, empower you, mortal - should you so choose.The path before you is one full of peril. You must decide whether to accept our help. Ponder this and speak with me again when a decision has been made."
5162,"It is the arcane that I control and the arcane which will send you to your next destination.When you are ready, the journey will begin. To the Plaguelands you will go and to Jeziba you will speak.He is a mortal as wise as the ancients and as patient as the immovable earth. Find him in Andorhal."
5163,"It's all ready, <name>!Now, I sent some mail to my friends already, telling them that I have a surprise for them. This is where you come in!I'm going to give you my mechanical yeti, and you need to surprise them by paying each of my friends a visit, turning the yeti on and sending it towards them.Once you have shown Legacki in Everlook, Sprinkle in Gadgetzan, and Quixxil in Marshal's Refuge, come back and tell me what happened!Please bring my yeti back to me then, too."
5164,"A finer instrument of justice, Haleh could not have chosen. Read from the catalogue of the wayward and be enlightened.Should you persist... should you do what is asked of you... should you survive... a hero you will make."
5165,"Now, you must return to Jaedenar. The braziers are more than likely spread throughout Shadow Hold. Douse each of their flames and the protections the Council has set up will fall for at least a short period of time. I will be waiting for that to happen. When it does, I will look deep within the Hold and try to find out who the head of this beast is. Then, and only then, will we see about attacking them directly."
5166,"The forging of a powerful breastplate to protect against the unrelenting attacks of the chromatic flight is one built upon irony.The scales of the very beasts we battle must be sewn to the pristine carapace of an elder chromatic drake or dragon. None are known to exist at this time and we should hope that none will ever exist.Lastly, perhaps the most difficult of all components: the blood of heroes.The Sculptor must ultimately forge this creation."
5167,"The carapace of a mature chromatic drake is needed to form the foundation of the leggings. Brilliant chromatic scales are then layered upon the wire frame and enchanted in the blood of heroes. Finally, the supple skin of shadow must be applied to the inner greaves."
5168,"The heroes of Darrowshire hold a place in my heart, and the book you brought me, the Annals of Darrowshire, tells their tales.It tells of the paladin Davil Lightfire and how the Crusade took his libram to the town hall of Hearthglen.Its passages also speak of my brother, Captain Redpath.  After his betrayal, his shield was cracked and discarded and now lies in the most unlikely of places -- near the barn of Gahrron's Withering.Gather these relics, <name>.  For fate and tragedy surrounds them."
5181,"The Annals of Darrowshire tells of the villains of that battle.  It tells how the ghoul lord Horgus the Ravager was destroyed by Alliance forces during the battle.  His body was cast into a lake, northwest of Corin's Crossing, and his skull remains there.Marduk the Black was never defeated, but his fabled sword was shattered and lost.  It lies at the bottom of the gorge west of Corin's Crossing.Retrieve these items, <name>.  I know not why, but I am certain their fate lies with you."
5201,"My presence goes unnoticed by most, <name>. However, there is an annoyance that seems firmly rooted here in Winterspring: the Winterfall furbolg."
5202,"The small red key seems to be made of some kind of bone material. It is heavy in your hand, but appears very fragile. Why would a member of the Shadow Council have such a thing? Perhaps there is something within Jaedenar that this strange key unlocks."
5203,"But, as much as it pains me, there is one thing that must be done first: I have to find Trey's sword Lightforge and escape Shadow Hold to tell my superiors what's happening here. Can you help me, <name>?Our equipment isn't far from here, and you've already proven you can survive the path to the top.After we escape, I'll head to Darnassus if you can find my friend Jessir near the Ashenvale border. She was to meet us at the Emerald Circle's camp near there.What do you say, <name>? Can you help me again?"
5204,"She would like to pretend that she's fine. She'd love for me to think that she's strong enough to deal with all of this on her own, but I know better than that. Trey's death and hearing the torture he was put through is going to haunt her for a long time, and there's nothing we can do to stop that. But we can give her some peace!<name>, return to Shadow Hold, kill Trey's torturer and find his remains. There is no reason we can't tie off all these loose ends while Arko'narin mourns in her own private way."
5206,"Chromie said the relics you gathered are reagents to a powerful spell, and one more is required: skulls from the scourge who took part in the battle of Darrowshire.Take this crystal and hunt scourge champions for their skulls.  The crystal is enchanted; if a champion took part in the battle, then when you pass the crystal over its skull it will resonate.  Bring me those resonating skulls.Go, <name>.  You'll find scourge champions in the Noxious Glade to the north and the Fungal Vale to the west."
5210,"The Annals of Darrowshire, through my magic, has gained pages at its end, and now it extends its history beyond the battle.  One of the extra passages tells of another Redpath, Carlin, who survived Joseph's betrayal.  Carlin's now in the Plaguelands to the east, at the Light's Hope Chapel.Take the book and speak with him."
5211,"Many of the defenders fell at the battle of Darrowshire.  And many roam again as the ghastly servants of the Scourge!  Find these poor souls and end their misery!Hunt cannibal ghouls, gibbering ghouls and diseased flayers.  Many of these fiends were once the good folk of Darrowshire and destroying their forms now will set their souls free.You will find them in Plaguewood and Corin's Crossing, and in other Scourge strongholds of Eastern Plaguelands."
5212,"The Forsaken apothecaries are not the only beings in this world schooled in the sciences.I have been studying the plague for years, <race>. We had previously thought that the potency of the plague was dwindling, but what I have discovered here in the Plaguelands is startling. The plague seems to be growing in strength!I need to run more tests! The most potent source of the plague is from the tainted flesh of the most recently infected. Travel to Stratholme and bring me samples, <name>."
5213,"You will have to delve deeper into Stratholme, <name>.Beyond the first gates you will find the ziggurats. We know that the Scourge draws great power from these structures. Search the Ziggurats and return with any information that you may discover."
5214,"Terrible thing... what happened to Fras. You see, the town was sacked and Fras didn't want to leave his precious goods behind. The last thing I remember him saying was, 'I'll burn every last leaf before they get their damned, dirty hands on them!'I may love a good stogie but I'm no fool. I left Fras and his delightful store that day. I assume he went down in flames but if there's a chance that even one box of his famous tobacco is still intact...What do you say, <name>? Find a box for ol' Smokey?"
5215,"Within the lands of former Lordaeron are eight cauldrons - four here in the west, and four more ensconced in the east.  These cauldrons spew poisons into the air, propagating the plague throughout the land for the Scourge.The necromantic might of Kel'Thuzad is too strong to outright shut down these cauldrons, but we think we might have a way to subvert them to our advantage.  My second, High Priestess MacDonnell, will be your point on this assignment; she'll continue the briefing from here."
5216,"Of the four cauldrons here in the west, the one located at Felstone Field may be the easiest one in obtaining access to.  The Scourge have greener troops positioned here, though they should not be underestimated.Go to Felstone Field, northwest of Andorhal, and engage the cauldron lord there.  We think it has a key that will unlock access to the cauldron.  When unlocked, use this bottle to obtain a sample of the poisons inside the cauldron; we'll need it for study in developing a counter agent."
5217,"You fill the bottle with enough of the cauldron's poisonous concoction for a suitable sample to be studied.With the poison in hand, it is time to return to High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp to complete the mission."
5219,"One of the plague cauldrons is located in the field of a former farmhouse now referred to as Dalson's Tears.  Well, we shall shed no tears this day as we thwart the Scourge and have them choke on their own fumes!Go to Dalson's Tears, almost due north of Andorhal, and eliminate the cauldron lord there.  It should have a key like the last one did, allowing you into the cauldron.  Use this bottle to obtain a sample from inside the cauldron; each cauldron has its own distinct brew of toxins it uses."
5220,"You carefully fill the bottle with enough of the cauldron's ichors for what you consider to be suitably sized sample.With the poison in hand, it is time to return to High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp to complete the mission."
5222,"Two cauldrons have been successfully opened; while you will be able to access them indefinitely, we still want to open up the other two that remain.  This will provide all of us with more options to introduce the counter agent!This time, you'll be hitting the Writhing Haunt's cauldron.  It is almost due east of Andorhal, relatively close to the ruined city walls; again, eliminate the cauldron lord present there for its key.  Use this bottle to obtain the sample from the cauldron.Good hunting, <name>!"
5223,"You delicately top off the empty bottle; a sample of the foul substance that churns under the platform of the cauldron now oozes back and forth inside the fragile glass container.With the poison in hand, it is time to return to High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp to complete the mission."

5241,"Sometimes, when it's nighttime, I can hear my Uncle Carlin crying.  It sounds like he's far away, to the east.I hope he's not crying for me!  <name>, will you find my uncle and tell him I'm alright?If you find him say I'm waiting for him, and I want to hear the story he used to tell... the one about the rabbits and the berry jam!  That story's so funny!"
5242,"Unfortunately, I see the only way to stop this threat to Felwood is a frontal attack. There are no other ways into Shadow Hold, and I have no means to teleport you inside. The straight path down to the bottom is the only way... and I also know who you should seek out. His name is Fel'dan... Shadow Lord Fel'dan. He is the mortal in power down below... he is the head of the serpent. Kill him and his two succubus servants and return to me. Fel'dan is the one making pacts with the Legion. He must be stopped."
5243,"I look at my undeath as a malady, <race>. An illness that merely requires treatment; however, it is also a great blessing for the Argent Dawn. What better vessel to smite the heathens of the Scourge than through the undead?I am revered by my colleagues because of the sacrifices I have made, but the accolades mean nothing to me.If you are interested in assisting the Argent Dawn, then a job I can offer.Venture to Stratholme and recover our surplus of holy water. Search the supply crates."
5244,"The story behind Kel'Theril is one of a cursed race, bound to the place where they attempted an unfortunate ritual...The highborne that you will find there once stole a sacred artifact, believing that they could siphon its power for themselves, becoming even more powerful. In their efforts, the relic shattered in a huge explosion, driving the pieces below the ice of the lake...Speak with Jaron Stoneshaper if you'd like to learn more; he has recently visited the area and can tell you more."
5245,"The highborne spirits are miserable creatures, that's for sure. They are still searching for pieces of the very thing that has cursed them to Kel'Theril forever -- the stolen relic.If you are that interested, take my pick and go south to the lake, see if you can gather the pieces of it from within the ice.Now, I can't tell you a thing about what you find, but I do know of someone who might... Aurora Skycaller; she dwells near the Northpass Tower in the northern part of Eastern Plaguelands."
5246,"I did not realize... Forgive my callous words, <class>.The mistakes of my ancestors are not what I wish to dwell on, but if your request is truly genuine, then I will help you.<Aurora examines the fragments.>I believe this is the Crystal of Zin-Malor, an artifact that can contain and control strong arcane forces. It could have been used for good, but the evil intentions of those that stole it caused it to shatter.Go to the Temple of Zin-Malor in Azshara - I can only hope the book is still there."
5247,"I will be able to help you, if recreating the artifact is truly what you wish to do.To seal the pieces back together, I will need items with strong magical qualities. An enchanted thorium bar and five crystal restore... You'll also need to collect some water from what might seem an unlikely place... Find the dire pool along Eldreth Row at Dire Maul in Feralas, and fill this vial.While you are gone, I will attempt to glean from these pages the knowledge I need to repair the damage done to the relic."
5248,"<name>, I weep for what has happened in the past. Like this crystal, the elves, as a race, have been shattered. I do not know if the pieces will ever again be reunited into one, but my sorrow has been eased by being able to help you with this one small task.We must not forget the past, <name>...Please take the Crystal of Zin-Malor back to Lake Kel'Theril. You must find a highborne spirit that realizes the error of what was done so long ago. Show the spirit that we have made things right again."
5249,"In Winterspring, to the north of here, there are many ancient elven ruins. It's a harsh land, but it holds many secrets and places to explore.With all my work to do here in Felwood, I have not had the opportunity to travel to Winterspring. But there's no reason why you shouldn't!While you're there, look for Wynd Nightchaser. He spends most of his time in Starfall Village and he knows a lot about the area."

He spends most of his time in Starfall and he knows a lot about the area.Tell him that you are a student of mine..."
5251,"Anything taken to an extreme is hazardous to our world, <name>. Take for example, the Scarlet Crusade. Do you believe that their blind zealotry serves a greater good? How many innocents have they destroyed in the name of the Light?Blasphemers, one and all!One in particular interests me, though; the Archivist Galford of Stratholme: A man that watches over the Crusade's most valued documents. Destroy him and burn down his archives! Should you succeed, return to me and be rewarded."
5252,"The... the crystal...The highborne here are clouded by their own misssery...I am sorrrrrowful, but I realize the errorrrr of what happened so long ago. Even though there is no waaaay to change the past, I am now at peacccce knowing that you have recovered the crystal of Zin-Malor...Youuu must return it...It muuuussst be returrrned."
5253,"Quite impressive, <name>.The crystal of Zin-Malor can never be returned to the temple which, as you know, lies in ruin. But I believe that your effort to undo the evil of the past should not go unrewarded.Seek out Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus, and bring the crystal to him, <name>. It should be in the hands of those that will not abuse its power. From the looks of it, only a handful of the strongest magic users would be able to control such a power."
5261,"Eagan Peltskinner is looking for someone to hunt wolves for him.  That's good news, because we're seeing a lot more wolves in Northshire Valley lately.If you're interested then speak with Eagan.  He's around the side of the abbey, to the left."
5262,"You try and gather your thoughts as the dust settles across the chamber. You go over the events that just transpired and still cannot comprehend the gravity of the situation.The Grand Crusader of the Scarlet Crusade a demon? And not just any demon but brother to Varimathras, arch lord of the Undercity?You carefully stow the severed head of the dreadlord into your pack. Surely, none would believe the tale you would tell without proof.Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff must be told at once!"
5263,You display a natural aptitude for destruction and you follow orders. It is rare to see the two coexist. I am beginning to think that you may make an excellent vehicle of divine justice.<Zverenhoff clasps his hands together in front of his face.>Kel'Thuzad's errand boy rules over Stratholme. Prove to me that you are a champion - my champion. Destroy Baron Rivendare and return to me with his head.
5264,"I am about to bestow a great honor upon you, <name>.Lord Maxwell wishes to reward you for your service to the Argent Dawn!It has been years since Maxwell has granted audience to outsiders."
5265,"Through the years the Argent Hold has remained locked. None have been worthy to reach inside and take from it the power of the Argent Dawn - until today.The Argent Hold is now open to you, <name>."
5281,"There are those that died tragically in the fall of Stratholme. Many took their own lives, opting to hurl themselves into the myriad flames of the smoldering city rather than become one of the Scourge.They now walk the streets of Stratholme as restless spirits.We must aid them, <name>!I have an associate named Egan who has been doing miraculous work with ghosts and souls. Seek him out. He walks the eastern Plaguelands, near Stratholme, testing his innovations."
5282,"I draw my power - my will to continue living and breathing - from the unmitigated hatred I have for the Scourge and all that they have done. I am, however, no zealot. There are those, like the Scarlet Crusade, who would sooner destroy the innocent undead than lend them even an ounce of compassion.Which brings me to this: My blaster. It will unchain the tortured souls from Stratholme.Use it on the ghosts that haunt the ransacked streets. Free their souls."
5283,"So ye made the smart decision.There ain't no love lost betwixt me an old Ironus here. That good for nothing toy maker knows who the true craftsmen round here be.The truly great wars are won with a good defense. When it be go time, no offense is gonna be helping ye out.Right, so let's get to work. All ye need to do is show me that ye've got some raw talent. After that, I'll yank whatever impurities be left in ye and mold ye into an armorsmith. Ye do know how to make ornate mithril, don't ye?"
5284,"As a weaponsmith you'll find that more often than not, heroes and adventurers will be coming to you for gear. While the workload can be unbearable at times, the riches more than make up for the back strain and ash lung.Oh yes, <name>, weaponsmiths are the ones with all the gold!If you wish to join our ranks, you'll need to show me that you can make me a silver or two - I mean, show me that you've got what it takes to be the go to < guy/girl> when people need superior quality weapons. Get to work!"
5301,"Satisfaction. It is what I draw from the hammer and the anvil. To see a proud Horde warrior protected under my steel reminds me of what it is to be alive. It is an addiction that I dare never give up, <name>.I can not grant you this satisfaction, merely set you upon the path. As with all of life's endeavors, the path of the armorsmith is a journey.If you wish to be one of the select few, you need only to ask and I shall train, but, a task you must first complete."
5302,"One day, I will create a legendary hammer. A hammer fit for a Warchief!It is my life's work, <name>. My passion. I recognize that you have the potential to be among us, one of us - a weaponsmith. I am the one that can help you harness that potential.A simple task is all that you must complete. Simple for one of your exceptional skill."
5305,"Within the confines of the Scarlet Bastion lies sweet Serenity. The Crimson Hammersmith guards the recipe with his life. Defeat him and bring me his apron. For that, I shall reward you with the knowledge required to create an enchanted battlehammer!"
5306,"Don't let her beauty fool you, <class>. The shadow huntress, Vosh'gajin is deadly and deranged.<Kilram points to the scar on his face.>Aye, she gave me that - a love tap, she called it.The time for vengeance has finally come.You can find Vosh'gajin in Blackrock Spire. Slay her and return to me with her snakestone. Do this and I will teach you the secret to crafting Dawn's Edge!"
5307,"If I am short with you, it is for a reason. The plans for the creation of the great blade, Corruption, have been stolen by the Black Guard: Elite skeletal units of Baron Rivendare.Yes, Baron Rivendare of Stratholme.The Black Guard swordsmith now guards those plans with his... undeath.Slay him and return proof of this deed and I shall grant you the knowledge required to create a blazing rapier!"
5321,"I was on my way to Maestra's Post to meet Liladris Moonriver, but I decided to stop here and take a short nap. Ever since I awoke from the emerald dream, I have been so sleepy...<yawn>Would you mind showing me the way? I understand that Maestra's Post is south of here, along the road in Ashenvale. It can be dangerous, so I hope you have some friends that will join us.Lastly, I may fall asleep so if you ever need to wake me, please use my horn. You'll find it in the chest here."
5341,"Within the Scholomance lays the Barov family fortune. I, Alexi Barov, am one of the last two remaining heirs of the house Barov. My brother, Weldon, is the other.Weldon, the miserable coward, fled during the war and thus retained his worthless existence as a human.He now searches for the deeds so that he may claim the fortune for his own. Recover the deeds before my brother does and I shall make you wealthy beyond your wildest dreams!"
5342,"Naturally, with my brother still alive, there may be some contention as to the primary beneficiary of the family's fortune. This cannot be.A low down guttersnipe like you isn't above a little cold-blooded murder, I hope.It's a simple task and one that I expect you will complete; that is, if you wish to claim your reward.Weldon sits under Alliance protection at Chillwind Camp, to the east. Slay him, return his head.<Alexi yawns.>Hurry along now."
5343,"My dear brother Alexi. What a fool I was to spare his life. I looked into the face of the enemy, one of the undead, and let him live.<Weldon spits.>He now searches for MY inheritance. This simply cannot happen.Find my family's deeds before that vile retch gets his boney hands upon them and I shall reward you with vast riches. They lay in the ruins of the Scholomance. Make haste!"
5344,"With the deeds recovered, there is but one thing left to do. Alexi must be killed. With him dead, I need not ever worry about an unscrupulous gang of mercenaries seeking my head.It's a simple task. Alexi hides under the protection of the Horde - at the Bulwark.No, I do not expect you to just walk up and kill him, I want his head! How you get it... well, that part is up to you. That type of behavior is below one of my noble upbringing."
5361,"My brother Nataka is stationed at Ghost Walker Post over in Desolace. I'd like to ask you... could you give this report to him for me? A year has passed since the last time I wrote, there has been unusual centaur activity since then and he should be informed.Journey to Stonetalon Mountain north of the Crossroads, and then head west into Charred Vale. From there, head south into Desolace; there you will find a road going south to Ghost Walker Post."

5382,"Krastinov is responsible for the deaths of thousands. He must be punished, justice must be meted out.Find him and exact upon him the agony he has inflicted upon countless innocents. Once he is destroyed, burn our remains. Turn them to ashes, <name>."
5384,"This is it, <name>.<Eva points to the vial inside the bag.>The blood of innocents. The purest blood, used to appease Krastinov's master.It is with this blood that Kirtonos may be summoned. It is with this blood, then, that Kirtonos must be destroyed.Take the blood to the porch. Place it upon the brazier. Kirtonos will come - he cannot resist. When he appears, unleash the fury and wrath of a thousand innocent deaths upon him.Should you succeed, you will earn more than just our gratitude."
5385,You pick up the sack carefully and prepare to make your way back to Jessir Moonbow on the border of Felwood and Ashenvale. Hopefully the paladin will be given the proper respects once you've passed his remains on to his friends.
5386,"The smell of cooked fish has long been missing here at Ghost Walker Post. The trolls at Shadowprey Village are the best at catching fish... but alas, with all the centaur activities I have little time to make a journey to the trolls. Hrm...Do me a favor and journey to Shadowprey Village. Talk to the local fisherman Jinar'Zillen and bring me back my favorite, Bloodbelly fish. The road south of here will take you west to the troll village."
5441,"Cursed peons!  They work hard gathering lumber from the trees of the valley, but they're always taking naps!  I need someone to help keep the peons in line.You look like the right <race> for my task.  Here, you take this blackjack and use it on any lazy peons you find sleeping on the job.  A good smack will get them right back to work!  Return the blackjack when you're done.Lousy slacking peons..."
5461,"The undead fear life just as the living fear death. It is not unusual for a sentient undead being to completely destroy all remnants of his or her previous life after having turned.Unfortunately, in order to create an artifact capable of reverting Ras Frostwhisper to a mortal, we must have a keepsake from his years among the living.You must venture to the ruined city of Stromgarde, Frostwhisper's home, and search for such an item. May luck be with you, <name>."
5462,"Upon tainted soil, the keepsake must be attuned.It is rumored that Stratholme is where Frostwhisper succumbed to the Lich King. Upon those bloodied grounds he gave his life - freely and with motive - to become one of the undying.It is those grounds that must be found.There is one, an undead dissenter of the Scourge, freed by the Banshee Queen but loyal to the cause of the Argent Dawn. Find him: Leonid Barthalomew the Revered. He may know more. Seek out Light's Hope, <name>."
5463,"I watched as the human, Ras Frostwhisper, pledged his undying soul to the Lich King. He drew the dagger to his own throat and with a smile, cut from ear to ear. His body collapsed inside the borders of the pentagram. The Lich King stood over the fallen mage and with a single motion, Ras Frostwhisper the lich, was born.<Leonid gazes at the ground and then looks up at you.>Yes, <race>, I remember. What you seek has a name - Menethil's Gift: The ground blessed by the Lich King - holy ground to Scourge."
5464,The soul of the fallen clings to that which represents its former life and transforms the item into a soulbound keepsake. You pick the item up and place it in your pack.
5465,"Return to Marduke with the keepsake, <name>. He will instruct you in its use."
5466,"There is but one task remaining, <name>. Confront the lich, Ras Frostwhisper, in his lair.Use the power of the keepsake against the beast -  be unrelenting in your actions!  Weather the blows that the flailing beast will surely bring down upon you. Do not give in to the pain!When the ritual is complete, Ras will be mortal once more. It is at that point that he must be slain. Strike him down and take his human head."
5481,Master want weeds. Us gots big hands and not good at picking. You help us and we not hurt you. Us need gloom weed. Many weeds around here and near road.When you have gloom weed you take to Master Holland in Brill graveyard.
5482,"So you can see the predicament that I'm in, <name>. That thing is out there collecting the wrong weeds! I'll make it worth your while to gather what I need. Bring back to me enough doom weed and I'll give you a suitable reward.It is my understanding that they like to plague the flora near the mass gravesite, to the north of the Brill graveyard. Hurry and be mindful of the gnolls in the area."
5501,"We're sitting on a goldmine here, I tell you - a goldmine!  Kodo bones will change the world forever... I have customers making furniture, music instruments, and even blasting powder out of them.There's a caravan that comes by and picks up my kodo bones and then sells them at Shadowprey Village.  If you can travel to the kodo graveyard south of here and bring me ten kodo bones, I'll give you something in return.  Is it a deal?"
5502,"You have been so very kind to me, <name>.  I never dreamed that I'd have so much fun during Children's Week.  Thank you.  I won't be sad about what's happened to me - my parents always told me to rise above anything bad that happens.  I'll be a hero... just like you.I'm sad to say this, but it's time for me to go home.  Let's go back and I'll tell the matron what an awesome person you are!"
5504,"Your service to the Argent Dawn is to be commended, <name>.  You are truly revered amongst us.  I have been authorized to make available for you to purchase one of the Dawn's most valued items - our magic resistance mantles."

5514,"The goblin you will need to speak with is Krinkle Goodsteel.  He peddles his skills to the highest bidder in Gadgetzan, within the Tanaris desert.  He'll likely be the only one who can produce the mold we need, and his services won't come cheap.  We now ask for you to dig deep by footing whatever fee he will charge.I'm an apothecary, not a banker.  If I had gold lying around, I certainly wouldn't be here.I guess I said the quiet part out loud again.  Oops.Gadgetzan awaits you!  Good luck!"
5515,"A great weight has been lifted from our hearts, <name>, but your task is not yet complete. Krastinov's master, Kirtonos, still lives.Before you may face Kirtonos, however, you must first secure a method in which to summon him.It is said that Jandice Barov stewards the blood of innocents from Krastinov to Kirtonos.Find her in the sunken catacombs of Scholomance and strike her down. Bring back any clues that you may find."
5517,"< Brother / Sister> <name> - your deeds on behalf of the Argent Dawn are far too numerous to be recounted easily.  As a fitting tribute, I'll part with one of our special Chromatic Mantles of the Dawn - a version that protects the wearer from all forms of resistible magic simultaneously.  Chromatic Mantles of the Dawn are reserved for only the mightiest of the Dawn's heroes!"
5518,"If you're going to fight the king of this dump - and I think that's what you're bound to do - then you're going to need to get by Captain Kromcrush.  Now, you can get by him by killing him, sure.  You might actually want to leave him alive.How, you ask?  Since I've been here, I think I know how to make an ogre suit that will last just long enough to fool these bozos.  The only problem is stability - ten minutes tops.  Bring me what I need, and I'll make you one.  I'm not going anywhere..."

5522,"I received a message from my master, Vectus.  Well, the message wasn't really from Vectus...it was from someone named Leonid Barthalomew.  I don't know Leonid, but he knew my master, and no one knows my master unless he allows it.Leonid says Vectus wants the dragon eggs.  He wants you to deliver them to him at the Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.That hurts!  Why you?  Doesn't Vectus trust me?  Oh, never mind... just take the eggs and tell Leonid that I did what our master commanded."

5526,"Your knowledge of Eldre'Thalas - Dire Maul - in Feralas will now come into play, <name>.  In the eastern part of the ruined city is where Alzzin the Wildshaper has exerted his corrupt dominion.  Go there with all due haste and brave whatever challenges await you.The Fruit of Fertility, now corrupted as the Felvine, should be close to Alzzin.  When he falls, capture whatever essence of the Felvine you can.  Seal it in the Reliquary, and bring it to me.Good luck, and Cenarion's speed."
5527,"The first step is to find a container capable of holding an extremely corruptible substance without the handler suffering ill effects.  There is only one sort device I am aware of that could possibly contain something as vile as the Felvine: a Reliquary of Purity.Deep in the wasteland of Silithus is the remnants of the night elf village known as Southwind.  I know one was there many, many years ago.  If we are to succeed, I need you to scour those ruins in the hopes of reclaiming it."
5529,"The Argent Dawn recently learned that the Scourge are creating their own plagued dragonflight!  We must stop them -- if the Scourge gain a force of dragons they'll sweep across Azeroth unchecked!Their necromancers are breeding plagued dragons at the Scholomance, in the middle of Darrowmere Lake.Go to the Scholomance and kill as many hatchlings as you can... before they get any bigger!"
5531,"The eggs you brought were to be used in Scourge experiments to create a plagued dragonflight.  These frozen black dragon eggs would have been invaluable in their studies, and would have assuredly quickened their timetable.Now, it is time we ended their research.Take the frozen eggs to Betina Bigglezink outside.  She is well-learned in science and alchemy, and has produced a weapon we can use against the Scourge.  With your help, we will deal them a heavy blow."
5533,"On the island of Caer Darrow lies Scholomance - a wretched center of Scourge necromancy and evil.  Our enemy dwells within, conducting unspeakable acts of depravity on unwitting victims... at least, we surmise as much.  A door bars the way, and try as we might no entry is to be had without a proper key.Alchemist Arbington is well versed on Scholomance, and has an idea how to obtain a key.  You have proved your worth to me, and now I entrust this task to you.  Speak with him on this matter."
5534,"What?! What?!That wasn't good enough for you? You know how expensive those explosives are? They sell for... oh, nevermind. Fine, you want to make some real money? Cause that's how business is done: you prove you're a valuable employee and then you're rewarded adequately after you stick it out some.If you're a ""valuable"" employee, then hit the Ruins of Eldarath and find me some rune that them Blood elves were lookin' for. The naga apparently have it in their possession."
5535,"Long ago, the Highborne were some of the most powerful students of the arcane the night elves ever produced. The corruption that comes along with such studies caused much harm to night elf society and greatly affected all of Azeroth... as I'm sure you well know.I promised the Sentinels that I would release the spirits from their mortal bonds as I find them. If you would do the same, then I am sure I can reward you some.The spirits haunt the Shadowsong Shrine to the northeast of here."
5536,"The satyr, a disfigured, evil aspect of the night elves, now infect the sacred lands once traveled by Cenarius. I cannot speak for the night elves when it comes to all the atrocities those demonic creatures have committed, but I have sworn an oath to the Earthmother to aid the elves in ridding the land of such a nuisance.I am sure you would prove yourself if you aided me in purging them.Northeast of here, you can find the Haldarr clan. Return to me after you've tested yourself against their power."
5537,"The key to Scholomance is called a Skeleton Key.  It must be forged from the remains of a skeleton - several actually - and hardened by only the strongest of metals within a suitable mold.  A signet of power from a being who naturally can open the portal to Scholomance will make the key ultimately function.First thing's first though, <name>.  We'll need skeletal fragments for the key's forging.  Skeletons inside Andorhal should yield what we need, but the ones outside the walls might work too."
5538,"The goblin you will need to speak with is Krinkle Goodsteel.  He peddles his skills to the highest bidder in Gadgetzan, within the Tanaris desert.

5541,"Hegnar Rumbleshot sells guns off the road to Anvilmar.  Riflemen and mortar teams spend a lot of time practicing out near his shop, and he's always needing fresh ammunition.But... the last crate of ammo I sent him got lost along the way.  My courier said he was camped near the Grizzled Den when wendigo chased him away... and the fool left Rumbleshot's ammo behind!<name>, can you get that ammo and take it to Rumbleshot?  He's been waiting on it and I'm sure he's running low."
5542,"If you are going to remain here, I ask only that you earn your keep. We have many nuisances that could use some 'discipline.'You can start with the Plaguehounds and their runts.I cannot offer much in return, but you are guaranteed a warm meal and some conversation should you succeed."
5543,"Woe to those that foolishly wander into the Plaguelands. All manner of foulness inhabit these woods - from the fanatical Scarlet Crusade, who will kill any that do not bear the mark of the Crusade, to the murderous Scourge, who only look to bolster their numbers by adding more undead to their ranks.Even the wildlife have been transformed into rapacious, man eating beasts. I ask that you destroy those that would strike from the skies: The Plaguebats."
5544,"My food supplies are running low, <race>. I am ashamed to admit that I might not have enough food to share with you.Could you assist an old man with a simple task? Around here, the only manner of beast unaffected by the ravages of the Plague are the Carrion worms. While rather bland in taste, the meat of the worms can easily be preserved to last for months. I will need several hundred pounds to restock for the coming winter!"
5545,"I've got a real problem on my hands. I have a deadline looming for an order of lumber, and I'm running out of time. The wolves and bears north of here have chased my workers away from the bundles of wood that they've already chopped.I've already talked to Deputy Rainer about clearing the animals, but I need someone to go collect the wood for me. If you could collect eight bundles of wood for me I might just make my deadline."
5561,"Bibbly thinks he is the only goblin in Desolace who knows how to make money.  Well, the only caravan brave enough to travel these parts relies on me.  Ever since I learned how to rejuvenate and control aged and dying kodos with my kodo kombobulator, the caravan owner Cork, Rigger, and I entered a partnership.Take the kombobulator and use it on any ancient, aged, or dying kodos; it will jolt the beast into a tamed kodo and force it to follow you.  Once you have a kodo tamed, bring it back to me."
5581,"Behold - the Hand of Iruxos. A gruesome sight indeed.You must possess it if the demon portals at Mannoroc Coven are to be banished... which is what I now ask you to do. The Demon threat is increasing and we must close these portals to stem the tide of demons to this world. Good luck, <name>... and be wary of the portal guardians."
5582,"This is a scale shed from a plagued dragon hatchling.  But unlike the other pocked, oozing scales on the infant beast, this rare scale is healthy and unmarred.Betina Bigglezink will want a sample of this to study."
5601,"I fled Lordaeron during the great war, and was lucky to escape before the Scourge swept through my homeland and turned it into a plagued nightmare!  I was lucky, but my family was not.  I fear they were all killed during the battle of Darrowshire.Darrowshire is a village in the Eastern Kingdoms, nestled in the southern hills of what is now the Eastern Plaguelands.  Will you go there and search for my family?  I miss them so much, especially my little sister Pamela.Please, find her for me!"
5621,"I need your help, <name>. I am needed here to train the other students, but you, you can help one of our injured Sentinels just south of Dolanaar. She was hurt patrolling the town and could use our aid. Her name is Shaya.When you find her, heal her wounds, and then fortify her body with your spells. This will at least protect her from harm longer if she finds trouble. Return to me here after you've done your duty to Elune."
5622,"<name>, you must travel to Dolanaar when your business here in Shadowglen is done. There, you will find Laurna Morninglight. She will instruct you further in the ways of Elune, and it is with her that you will earn your first garments denoting your station as a <priest/priestess> of Elune.Take care, and may you be protected in your journeys."
5623,"Hello again, young <priest/priestess>. The time has come for you to learn more about our religion. After you've completed whatever tasks you have here in Northshire, please seek out Priestess Josetta in Goldshire. She has more to teach you and has heard that you are growing strong in the ways of the Light. She looks forward to tutoring you more."
5624,"Normally I put forth a small challenge to followers of the Light to test their skill. I want to see if they are worthy of wearing their first robes--a sign that the church outwardly approves of the <priest/priestess> and supports <him/her>.But this situation is a bit different. One of Goldshire's citizens saw an injured guard near the lake to the east of here. His name is Roberts. Find him, heal him, fortify his body and return here. If you can do that for me, then I will consider your test complete."
5625,"It's usually about this time that one of your power is tested to see if they're worthy of wearing robes denoting their place in the church. But to be honest, I got more pressing matters to look into. Citizen of Kharanos' just came in here and told me 'bout a hurt mountaineer just outside town to the south--name's Dolf.You heal Dolf and give him Fortitude, and I'll consider you done with proving yourself. How's that sound?"
5626,"Hey! <name>! Got a minute?!Ya been following the Light now for long enough that you find your way to Maxan Anvol in Kharanos. He'll teach ya more about the path yer following, and if you prove worthy, give ya yer first set of robes to denote your station as a <priest/priestess>.Now get goin'! As soon as yer done here, head through the tunnel--he'll be waitin' for ya."
5628,"Ah, yes, hello, <name>? I'm glad you stopped to talk for a moment. You are a far way from home at such a young age--I admire such ambition. I wish when I was younger I could have mustered the courage to travel the world.There was a priestess of your order here looking for you not too long ago. She said it was very urgent you returned to the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus and speak to Priestess Alathea--it had something to do with your training. I wouldn't dally too long if you can help it."
5629,"Hello again, <name>. I know you've been busy aiding our people, but you must take some time for yourself also. Priestess Alathea sent someone here looking for you. It seems that you've caught the attention of our elders and they feel you are prepared for greater things. Head to the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus and look for Alathea there. She will be waiting. Good luck, and may Elune be with you."
5630,"Hello there, <laddy/lassy>. Good to see you travelin' far and wide to distant lands. No offense meant, but a lot o' your kind don't take well to these cold climates usually. Glad to see you're made of tougher stuff.Not too long ago one of your priestesses was in here lookin' for you--said somethin' about you finding a Priestess Alathea in the Temple of the Moon back in Darnassus. Said it was important and you should head back there soon."
5631,"A priestess recently visited our halls seeking you out, young <race>. She said that she was on a mission to find you and that you should return to the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus as soon as possible. When you arrive, seek out a Priestess Alathea--she will tell you more.The Light be with you, <name>."
5632,"Oh, yes, of course. Hello, <name>. A messenger from our order was here not too long ago looking for you. She mentioned something important happening back in Darnassus and that you should return to the Temple of the Moon as soon as you can. When you arrive, speak to Priestess Alathea. I believe it has something to do with your progressing so well in our ways.Again, return to Darnassus when you can."
5633,"Greetings, <laddy/lass>. Good to see you here in our great halls. A blessing be on you and your kind.While you were traveling through our lands, a priestess of your temple came here seeking you. She said that you were to return to the Temple of the Moon as soon as possible. I'm sorry I can't tell you more, but it did sound important. When you get to the temple, speak to a Priestess Alathea."
5634,"You're needed in Stormwind, <name>. The High Priestess there, Laurena, says it's time for you to prove you're worthy of the next level of your training. Don't waste too much time finding your way there. You can find her in the Cathedral of Light in the center of the city. Give her my regards, and prove how worthy you are of such a calling. The Light be with you, <name>."
5635,"You've caught the attention of our superiors, <name>. They've asked you travel to the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind as soon as possible. Apparently they feel you've proven yourself already and are prepared to further your training. When you get there, find High Priestess Laurena. She will be able to guide you further. Good luck, and may the Light be with you."
5636,"Elune bless you, good <race>. I hope your Light finds you and protects you well this day.One of your priests was here not long ago looking for you. He mentioned you returning to the Cathedral of Light as soon as possible to speak with High Priestess Laurena. It seems you've done well to garner such attention. I wouldn't spend too much time here--your people have need of you."
5637,"Time's come for you to head to Stormwind, <name>. High Priestess Laurena in the Cathedral of Light wants to speak to you. Gotta be somethin' really good or really bad for the High Priestess to want you there personally, but I'm guessin' you've only done well for yourself and it's a good thing that she wants to speak to ya.But don't waste too much time 'round here. I'd head there as soon as you can."
5638,"Just a short time ago, one of your priests was here looking for you, <race>. He said that if I were to see you, I should direct you towards the Cathedral of Light. He said it was very important, but I would not be overly concerned if I were you. His demeanor seemed positive... as though it were good news. I wouldn't take too long in making my way there if I were you.Elune be with you, good <race>."
5639,"You're needed in Stormwind, <name>. The High Priestess there, Laurena, says it's time for you to prove you're worthy of the next level of your training. Don't waste too much time finding your way there. You can find her in the Cathedral of Light in the center of the city. Give her my regards, and prove how worthy you are of such a calling. The Light be with you, <name>."
5641,"<name>, your High Priest Rohan would have an audience with you in Ironforge. Make haste, my strong friend, your next test quickly approaches. Although I wish I could bear witness to your race's own special rites, my place is here. But may the Light go with you in your travels. Rohan should still be in the Mystic Ward once you reach the city. He will be waiting."
5642,"Something important is up in Orgrimmar, <name>.The normal messengers that come through here looking for troll priests usually are very casual. This time, they seemed to be in much more a hurry. Don't dally too long in Thunder Bluff. I'd return to the Valley of Spirits as soon as possible."
5643,"Like many of our own priests, your own tribe puts you through rites of passage. These rites often teach priests special abilities that are vital to their survival. I sense that time is upon you even as we speak. You must return to the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar and speak to Ur'kyo. What he teaches you might be very important for the future."
5644,"Ah, a wonderful day for you, <name>. I can see by the lessons you've learned that the time has come to send you back to Aelthalyste. There are things only she can teach you, and even then, only if you prove worthy.I will not spoil the surprise for you, but I remember when I was a young priest learning about true power... divine power. Yes, those were the days.Go back to Aelthalyste in the Undercity, <name>. She will be awaiting you in the War Quarter."
5645,"<name>, your High Priest Rohan would have an audience with you in Ironforge. Make haste, my strong friend, your next test quickly approaches. Although I wish I could bear witness to your race's own special rites, my place is here. But may the Light go with you in your travels. Rohan should still be in the Mystic Ward once you reach the city. He will be waiting."
5646,"Aelthalyste show our people great respect by sending them back to me for more training, and now I do the same for her tribe.You return to the Undercity, <name>. There, in the War Quarter, she be ready to teach you more 'bout your people and their ways. Go there, and do not wait long."
5648,"You be ready for your first test, <name>. South of Razor Hill, just outta town, one of our grunts be hurt fightin' off some o' Proudmoore's old troops. She not doin' too well, an' she benefit much if one of our kind could help her. Find her--her name be Kor'ja--heal her wounds, an' give her the blessin' of our ancestors.You do this, an' me thinks that be sufficient proof that you ready to move on in our ways."
5649,"Aye, mon. Our kind have joined the Horde because they be good for us. They loyal, and they teach us much 'bout tings like honor. But our old ways die hard. The orcs may not approve of all our traditions, but that not mean we can't continue to practice some them in secret.You know this, an' that's why I send you to Tai'jin in Razor Hill. She teach you more 'bout our history. She teach you the ways of our tribe. Go to her when you be ready."
5650,"Our power comes from darkness and shadow, <name>, but that is not your only role. You have acknowledged that there is merit in knowing the healing arts. This is wise. But before you can know the dark, you must also know the light. And for this, I have a test for you.North of the cemetery is a wounded Deathguard--Deathguard Kel. He has protected us from gnolls for some time, and needs healing. But, you must also fortify his body before he can return to duty. Do both with your spells, and then return to me."
5651,"There are many lessons that the Forsaken have learned through experience--things that some races can only begin to fathom. And although our path lies in darkness, you will find that a great many things rely on both the light and the dark. Your lessons shall teach you to use both... and with discretion. But heed my words: never forget we were forged in corruption and left to rot like so much carrion. The Darkness is our home.Seek out Dark Cleric Beryl in Brill when you're ready to learn more."
5652,"I sent here to make sure that you not wander too far from home, <name>. They send me to make sure you return home because Ur'kyo, greatest of our priests, wish to speak to you. You go there. You got to the Valley of Spirits in the orc city and you speak to Ur'kyo. He wait for you now."
5654,"It be time for you to meet with Ur'kyo, <name>. He be in the Valley of Spirits in the orc city. Go there and speak to him. It is time you learn more of the old ways of our kind. It time you be brought into the circle and made a true priest of our tribe."
5655,"I sent here to make sure that you not wander too far from home, <name>. They send me to make sure you return home because Ur'kyo, greatest of our priests, wish to speak to you. You go there. You go to the Valley of Spirits in the orc city and you speak to Ur'kyo. He wait for you now."
5656,"It always warms my undying heart to see priests from all cultures wander the world. To know that power exists that is not arcane and well within our grasp. That's why it is my honor to direct you home, <name>.Ur'kyo, your great priest in Orgrimmar, has asked for your presence. You can find him in the Valley of Spirits."
5657,"Home. Return home, young <race>.Your spiritual leader Ur'kyo begs you to return to him and speak about the path you travel.Go to the Valley of Spirits in the great Horde city of Orgrimmar. You will find him there."
5658,"You be far from home, <class>. You be needed there, back in your city under the ground. Your mistress, the one you be callin' Aelthalyste be needin' you back there. Like my tribe, there things you must learn only from her. Don't be stayin' here too long. You should be headin' to the War Quarter as fast as a zeppelin can carry you."
5660,"You be far from home, <class>. You be needed there, back in your city under the ground. Your mistress, the one you be callin' Aelthalyste be needin' you back there. Like my tribe, there things you must learn only from her. Don't be stayin' here too long. You should be headin' to the War Quarter as fast as a zeppelin can carry you."
5661,"You be far from home out here in the Bloodhoof Village, <name>. I be sent here to find priests of my own tribe to send back to speak to our leaders, but that not mean I cannot help you too.I hear word that your head priestess spirit want all Forsaken to come to her--there are things you must learn.Go to meet Aelthalyste in the War Quarter in that city of yours."
5662,"My respect to you and your kind, <name>. I normally teach only those of my own tribe. Your lessons come from Aelthalyste in the city once called Lordaeron.You should return to her if you're to learn those abilities that set you apart from other faiths.Go to the War Quarter in the Undercity and find your mistress there."
5663,"Aelthalyste sent word out to all her priests. We're to direct the younger of our order to the Undercity for more training. If you truly count yourself among our faithful, then you should return there also.You can find Aelthalyste in the War Quarter deep in the Undercity."
5672,"A wonderful day has come, <name>. You've reached the age in which our <priests or priestesses> are trained in abilities only Night elves know. But it is not for me to train you. You must return to the Temple of the Moon and speak to Priestess Alathea as soon as your business here is concluded. She will test you to ensure you're prepared, and only then will she teach you Elune's Grace."
5673,"You know you have access to any of our trainers at any time, <name>, but there are some things that we cannot pass on to you. One of those things are the teachings of your goddess Elune. She gives special abilities to her faithful, and if I'm not mistaken, it is time for you to return home to your Temple of the Moon to be tested.Return there when you can and speak to Priestess Alathea."
5674,"A wonderful day has come, <name>. You've reached the age in which our <priests/priestesses> are trained in abilities only Night elves know. But it is not for me to train you. You must return to the Temple of the Moon and speak to Priestess Alathea as soon as your business here is concluded. She will test you to ensure you're prepared, and only then will she teach you Elune's Grace."
5675,"Time's a wastin', <lad/lass>. It's time for you to return home to Darnassus. Priestess Alathea's sent word here that you're to return there for training. Seems they feel you're ready to be tested much like those who serve the Light. You should head out whenever you can. Alathea's message said that she'd be waitin' for you in the Temple of the Moon. Good luck."
5676,"It is time for you to return to Stormwind, young one. Your superiors there have called you back for more training. And although it disturbs me some, your race and mine are allies and I would not betray that.I do not mean to be so coy with you--my distrust of arcane magics, be they divine inspired or not, is still strong within me.You will know of what I speak after you return to your Cathedral of Light. Speak to High Priestess Laurena when you arrive."
5677,"As much as I'd like to show you our own special teachings of the Light, it is not our place. Your place is back in Stormwind with your own kind, <name>... for now. Believe me, I mean no offense. When you return to High Priestess Laurena in the Cathedral of Light you'll understand what I'm talking about--the time has come for your race to prepare you for the future; to separate yourself from others that follow a similar path."
5679,"Aelthalyste show our people great respect by sending them back to me for more training, and now I do the same for her tribe.You return to the Undercity, <name>. There, in the War Quarter, she be ready to teach you more 'bout your people and their ways. Go there, and do not wait long."
5680,"Like many of our own priests, your own tribe puts you through rites of passage. These rites often teach priests special abilities that are vital to their survival. I sense that time is upon you even as we speak. You must return to the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar and speak to Ur'kyo. What he teaches you might be very important for the future."
5713,"I was traveling to Auberdine with an important message when I was attacked by the furbolg Marosh and his trackers. During the attack I was poisoned, leaving me barely able to stand. I can make an antidote, but it will take time before it is ready.I would ask that you defend me until I can apply the antidote. I will aid you with my bow as best I can.Should we survive, I will be able deliver my message to Auberdine, while you speak with Onaeya at Maestra's Post to inform her of this incident."
5721,"Now, <name>, you will take part in battle of Darrowshire, and you will save Joseph Redpath.Place this relic bundle in the Darrowshire town square, and the spirits of Darrowshire will rise.  Join their battle and assure that these two things come to pass: Davil must survive beyond the death of Horgus, and Redpath must survive to be corrupted, then defeated.After defeating the corrupted Redpath, his spirit will be saved.  Speak with him, then return to his daughter Pamela."
5722,"The troggs are not the only thing that interested Magatha in Ragefire Chasm. She has heard word that one of her servants, a Maur Grimtotem, found something peculiar while in the Chasm, but he never made it out to show her what. She'd like Maur's body found--if it still exists--and any signs of what he found while attempting to speak to the troggs.Return to Magatha any items of interest, and I'm sure she would be very generous in her reward.Again, seek the Chasm in the darkest areas of Orgrimmar."
5723,"Beneath the city of Orgrimmar, stout creatures known as troggs started coming to the surface from deep below the lava filled tunnels. In her ever-benevolence, Magatha sought to make peace with the creatures, but they turned on her diplomats, killing them. She will not allow such treatment of the tauren people and now consider the creatures a threat to all of the Horde.She asks that you put an end to this trogg threat before it overwhelms the Horde from below. Find Ragefire Chasm and destroy them all."
5724,"You find a satchel under the body of the tauren. It is still gripped tightly in his arms as though he was trying to protect it while being attacked by the troggs.Removing the satchel from his vice-like grip, you stow it with your own equipment and prepare to make your way out of the tunnels and back to Rahauro in Thunder Bluff."
5725,"Many denizens of the Legion bestow gifts on their followers as you may well know. Some of these gifts the Dark Lady feels would be better off in her hands than in the hands of those with... lesser vision.A sect of the Shadow Council hidden in caverns below Orgrimmar known as the Searing Blade are a prime example. The Lady tells me that members of the Searing Blade have come into the possession of two powerful spell books--she would like to ""borrow"" these books from them. You will get them for her."
5726,"One thing I will not tolerate are traitors in our midst, <name>. But I would be a fool to play my hand so early--it would not sufficiently cut the corruption out of our lands and only cause the infection to grow worse.But you, a young adventurer, could go places my agents could not... could learn the truth... could find the true head of the beast.If you are brave enough, then enter Skull Rock to the east of Orgrimmar, find a lieutenant's insignia off one of the Burning Blade there, and return to me."
5727,"Now let us see if this insignia you found is worth the effort.There is a warlock within the city who believes he has my trust. He does not know that I realize where his true loyalties lie. He is in fact the leader of the Burning Blade. But do not rush off to do battle with him; he has a purpose, and we shall use him against our enemies.Take this insignia to him in the Cleft of Shadow here in Orgrimmar, speak to him and see if he believes you are one of his own, then return to me here."
5728,"Hmm, leaders of the Searing Blade... this concerns me most. If they are the ones of value to Neeru, then those are who we must target first. This satyr... Bazzalan, and the other Neeru mentioned--what was he, a warlock?--must be slain.Return to the Cleft of Shadow and enter Ragefire Chasm, <name>. Find these two leaders of the Searing Blade, and kill them. But be careful not to let Neeru know it was you who did this. You must retain your identity as one of his <brothers/sisters> in arms."
5729,"I think our next step should be to have you placed close to Neeru. If he is as agitated as reports suggest, then we may accomplish two things. One, you may be able to gain some greater knowledge about the Council or at least the Burning Blade, and two, he may just begin to trust you enough that he asks you to start to aid him. He may very well look at you as someone who can fill the void now that some of the leadership is in turmoil.Return to the Cleft and speak to him again, but do not be too overt."
5730,"You are one of my lieutenants! Prepare yourself, <class>. I will call upon you soon.My time spent on the Searing Blade may be all but wasted now, but that does not mean that the Shadow Council's schemes elsewhere must suffer. I will do what I can to minimize the damage here in Ragefire Chasm. In the meantime, I will have my agents in the Barrens and Ashenvale begin work on our newest agenda. Return to me soon."
5741,"The Burning Blade in Thunder Axe Fortress to the east is rumored to have acquired the Sceptre of Light from the Naga. Legend tells that the sceptre is able to sink entire cities under the great seas. The Burning Blade must not be allowed to possess such power.To that end, you must retrieve the sceptre yourself!  It is held by a Burning Blade seer, who studies the sceptre from atop one of the Thunder Axe watchtowers."
5742,"You have worked hard, friend. Rest your weary bones and allow me to properly introduce myself."
5761,"The primary task set upon me by our great Warchief is to root out the creatures responsible for infesting our lord's great city with demonic influence. The Burning Blade is one threat, but there are others; the Searing Blade for instance, who make their home in Ragefire Chasm, secretly attempting to subvert innocent members of the Horde.If they are to be stopped, then their leader must be slain--a Felguard named Taragaman the Hungerer.Kill him, and his heart will appease Thrall, of this I'm sure."
5762,"I have a package for an old customer of mine, a dwarf named Hemet Nesingwary. The package took weeks to arrive, and Hemet's long gone by now. He said he was going to Stranglethorn to hunt the beasts there, but he left me some money to send his delivery when I could.Hemet's a rich dwarf and it's a good idea to keep up relations with the rich ones, yeah? So... you want to deliver the package for me?I heard Hemet has a camp in Stranglethorn, north of Grom'gol."
5763,"Long ago, a dwarf came to this land. His name was Hemet and he wished to hunt great beasts. His skills with the rifle were uncanny, and we spent many days hunting together. Even the enmity between our peoples were forgotten.When he left Desolace for Stranglethorn, I vowed to one day welcome him back so that we may hunt again. Now is that time.Take this kodo horn to Hemet. He will know it is from me. You will find him in Stranglethorn, north of the Grom'gol Base camp."
5781,"To help Taelan regain what he has lost, you must gather items from his past.The first such item is a toy that I gave to him on his 7th birthday. It was his most cherished possession: A miniature war hammer; an exact replica of my very own.After I was banished for treason, his mother told him that I had died. He was taken to my false grave at the Undercroft, where he buried the hammer along with my memory - forever.You must venture to the Undercroft and recover Taelan's hammer."
5801,"You need two bars of thorium and a powerfully hot heat source to forge the key stem.  You're on your own for the thorium, but I can help with the heat.To our west in Un'Goro Crater is Fire Plume Ridge - a simmering volcano.  The lava lake up top is hot enough to fuse thorium and bone together.  Your gold has bought you a mold that simply requires you to dip it in the lake up top; the lava will take care of the rest.That's it on my end.  To finish your key, you'll need to talk to Arbington again."

5803,"Araj the Summoner lords over Andorhal from the ruined city's heart.  We know that he was the former leader of Scholomance before claiming the city as his own.  To finish the key, we will need his signet - called a scarab - mounted as the head of the key.Make your way into the heart of Andorhal, and break his hold on the city now that he is drawn into the open.

5845,"The Order of the Silver Hand was utterly decimated when Uther was slain.The boy held out for as long as he could. Pushed to the war torn hamlet of Northdale, he made his final stand.Were any of the Order left alive, he thought - and did it matter?It was with that thought that Taelan threw down the standard of the Order and renounced all that he had known. His honor left upon the blood soaked ground of Northdale.You must travel to Northdale and recover that symbol of lost honor."
5846,"When Taelan was a child, we would oft visit Caer Darrow on family excursions. On our last visit, an artist by the name of Renfray painted a portrait of us poised along the beachside. It is my fondest memory of both Taelan and Karandra. For it was at that moment, with my wife and son in my arms, that I felt a bond of love and family that I would never know again.If this painting still exists, you must find it.Travel to the ruined island of Caer Darrow and see if the painting or the artist remain."

5848,"The painting... It hung on the wall of my workshop - inside the Order's barracks - for years.After Tirion's trial was over, I knew that I could no longer keep the painting visible. I hid it in a place that they would never think to look.Travel to Stratholme and make your way deep inside what is now the Scarlet Bastion, search for a painting of our twin moons. Chip away at the paint until you uncover my master work, 'Of Love and Family.'May the Light guide your actions."
5861,"<name>, you have done all that I have asked thus far. Only one step remains in your quest of redemption.You must deliver the items you have collected to Taelan. Unfortunately, Taelan and his Scarlet Crusaders will attack you on sight.There is only one way in which to deliver my message and that is through a guise of deception.To the south you will find Uther's tomb. An old and trusted confidant of mine, Myranda, now resides there - seek her out. Show her the items and she will assist you."
5862,"I am what you would call, an illusionist. Though I may be able to create an illusion to allow you entry into Hearthglen, be warned; my powers have their limitations.Should you travel too far from these lands, the effects of the illusion will cease. The spell itself takes a great amount of concentration and power from me, and thus, I can only sustain the effect for a short time.Speak to me again when you are ready."
5863,"Just recently, a large band of nomadic ogres arrived in Tanaris. South of here, they have taken over a large area of the desert and formed a compound. Several smaller bands are currently wandering the desert, some of which have invaded the old troll ruins.The Dunemaul Compound must be destroyed! We cannot allow these ogres to build up a force.The leader of this band is named Gor'marok the Ravager; I believe that putting an end to his leadership will be the beginning of the end for the ogres."
5881,"The Horde does well keeping our troops fresh... since the Great War we have been prosperous here in Kalimdor.I need you to do me a favor, I have a lad by the name of Grish Longrunner protecting the Great Lift in the southern barrens. Give him this letter; the letter will let him know that I have a reserve warrior coming to relieve him of duty so that he can visit his family. He requested this sometime ago and he would be happy to hear the news."
5892,"Before the fighting started, we stored supplies for Dun Baldar in the Irondeep mine.  The troggs that surfaced there weren't much of a problem when we had spare troops to guard the mine, but now that we're fighting with the Horde we can't maintain control of Irondeep.We need the supplies in Irondeep, <name>.  Enter the mine and bring me a load of them."
5893,"The Coldtooth mine to the north was once an ideal place to store extra supplies, but now that the fighting with the Stormpikes grows fierce, we do not always have the spare warriors to station at the mine and protect it.  And so, control of the mine often falls to the Alliance, or to underground denizens...But we still need our supplies, <name>!  Go to the Coldtooth mine and bring me a load of them.  And be wary of enemies as you go; the tides of battle shift quickly in that place..."
5901,"So, to bring pain and strife to the Scarlet Crusade, I want to take their precious lumber mill from them. I'm sure the loss of such a resource will cause them a great deal of harm in defending and rebuilding the town for their own reasons. Will you help me, <name>?Start by taking this jar to Plaguewood in the Eastern Plaguelands. Fill it with the termites you find in their mounds throughout the woods. Come back when you have enough."
5902,"Now that we have plenty of termites, take this steel reinforced barrel to the Northridge Lumber Mill south of Hearthglen--you'll find it to the west of the road that leads you up to the town.Once there, place the barrel in the center of the lumber mill; someplace high, like on a crate or something.After you open it, the rest should take care of itself. Just come back here and I'll reward you for helping me."
5903,"I've tried many times to rout out the Scarlet Crusade through force alone, but to no avail. So, as an alternative, I've decided to make their lives more difficult.If you are willing to help, I want to infest that lumber mill with the most terrible species of termites ever found.In Plaguewood, near the once-great Stratholme, there is a breed that survived the plague and the Scourge combined. Find their mounds and fill this jar with them, so we can prepare them to be unleashed on the Crusade."
5904,"Now that we have the termites, take this steel reinforced barrel to the Northridge Lumber Mill south of Hearthglen--you'll find it to the west of the road that leads you up to the town.Once there, place the barrel in the center of the lumber mill; find someplace suitable, like on a crate and then open it. The termites should do their work from there and make the mill useless to the Crusade."

It has been decades, yet the memories of my father; those precious memories, they are what have kept me alive.I have dreams, stranger. In these dreams my father is with me. He stands proudly at my side as I am inducted into the Order. We battle legion of Scourge, side by side. We bring honor to the Alliance, to Lordaeron.I want not to dream anymore.Take me to him."

Start south of here at their camp near the small bulwark they've set up. If you prove strong enough, maybe I could get your help with my main goal."

6022,"You kill with purpose while you remain on my stead.Your first task is to feed my hounds.Take this mortar and pestle and travel to Corin's Crossing. Once there, you will find a robust selection of Scourge to slaughter. From their fresh carcasses I need living rot. Take that living rot and grind it up in the mortar, then let it sit to coagulate. Bring the coagulated rot back here.And imbecile, realize that living rot from the undead doesn't remain 'living' for very long. You must kill quickly!"
6023,"My real mission was to weaken the Scarlet Crusade's outlying forces and then infiltrate Hearthglen to gauge their numbers. I'm still in no shape to do it on my own, so perhaps I could ask you to aid me again, <name>? From what information I gathered before being discovered, the Crusade has two important members that are the backbone of their forces outside the town: Huntsman Radley and Cavalier Durgen. Kill them, and we're making progress. They should be along Hearthglen Pass outside the town proper."
6024,"Kill me.  Before it's too late.I am Hameya.  While traveling to Zul'Mashar, my brethren and I ate some bad meat... and we changed.  We are infected.I can feel the lich's words now, urging me to reach Zul'Mashar and infect more of my people.  I cannot resist, and so I wrote this scroll before my will left me.I buried a chest in dirt next to a wagon behind this crypt, but only my key will open it.  I have the key.  If you want my treasure, then find me.Kill me.  Before it's too late."
6025,"What? Really? You want to know more? But you've already done so much for me, <name>. I couldn't possibly ask you to enter Hearthglen itself on my behalf.Are you sure, <name>? Hearthglen is much more dangerous than the Pass--I cannot provide you any protection  or even information about what you might face.Well, if you really are willing to help, then enter the town and find a high place to gain a good view of the town. From there you can gauge their numbers and report them back to me. But be careful...."
6026,"These here Argent Dawn people commissioned ol' Smokey to do a little demolition work for 'em. Smokey's mammy ain't raised no dummy. When gold coin is slapped on the table, Smokey's services are available. That's my motto!Now I'd be willing to split the commission with you if you're willing to do a little legwork. Here's the deal: I'm going to head over to Plaguewood and mark the buildings we need destroyed. You gather the components for the bombs. Meet back here when you've got everything. Deal?"
6027,"<name>, I entrust you with the Gem of the Serpent. Place this gem on the Serpent Statue's hand on Ranazjar Isle, a small island northwest of here. Placing it will summon the one who protects the Book of the Ancients. This book contains the secrets of the naga, secrets that have been kept for centuries.  Bring this book to me, and we will learn much about our scaled foes!"
6028,"I am looking for a responsible individual to aid me in a small but nonetheless important matter.  I'm here as a representative of the Argent Dawn's interests to the local governance of Everlook.  I need to get a progress report to Argent Officer Pureheart at Chillwind Camp; it's a ways from here, located along the southern fringe of the Western Plaguelands.If I may be so bold - this would be a perfect means to introduce yourself to my superior and perhaps earn some work from her!"
6029,"I'm looking for a responsible individual to aid me in a small but nonetheless important matter.  I'm here as a representative of the Argent Dawn's interests to the local governance of Everlook.  I need to get a progress report to Argent Officer Garush at the Bulwark; it's a ways from here, located along the western fringe of the Western Plaguelands, east of Tirisfal Glades.If I may be so bold - this would be a perfect means to introduce yourself to my superior and perhaps earn some work from him!"
6030,"A recluse medium found in these parts by the name of Umbranse has provided the Argent Dawn with quite a literary masterpiece... one that amounts to quite possibly the largest collection of jibber-jabber I've ever seen written.One of the Dawn's most respected leaders, Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff, is a brilliant linguist.  Could you take this to him for me - for a reward, of course?  Light's Hope Chapel - that's where he's currently at, far in the eastern part of the Eastern Plaguelands."
6031,"In Timbermaw, we are content.  We do not like strangers.  This is good for us, but it is bad for trade."
6032,"Although the people of Timbermaw delight in the feel of runecloth, it is not sacred to us.  But mooncloth is sacred."
6041,"While you were gathering the supplies, I had some of my people handle marking the Scourge buildings we need demolished.Here's the plan: I'm going to give you ten sticks of my special compound. You're going to take them over to Plaguewood and plant them inside the Scourge structures that I've had marked for detonation.<Smokey snaps his fingers.>Bing! It's just that easy."
6042,"You cannot take two steps off of this farm without running into one of those obnoxious bats. I want to be able to take the hounds out and slaughter Scourge without being accosted by any damned, dirty bats. Obviously, I have better things to do with my time than mindlessly kill bats day in and day out. You, however, do not.What? Your training? This is your training! Now get out of my sight and don't come back until you've killed a fair number of those winged demons. Don't disappoint me."
6061,"As a tauren, it is important to follow the traditions of our ancestors by fighting mighty creatures. By besting these creatures, we are able to intake their spirits, allowing us to become closer to the Earthmother.In the same way, taming a beast to fight alongside us helps us become one with nature around us. Eventually, you will learn to tame a beast of your choosing. But all things take practice, and you have much to learn. Begin by taking this taming rod; you must tame an adult plainstrider."

You can find them quite close to Razor Hill. Practice your skills in battle with the boar at your side, then return to me."
6063,"As a hunter, it is important to remember the responsibility you hold in your hands. Nature is not a power that can be bent to obey our desires; it is one that is to be respected and acknowledged as something stronger than your very existence.<name>, you must prove your understanding of this before you will gain the ability to tame an animal to be your companion.Your first task is to take this taming rod. With it, you will be able to tame a webwood lurker. Tame it, and practice your skills as a hunter."
6064,"Hi there, <lad/lass>! So, you'd be wanting to know how you can gain a pet of your own?Well, let's get started. There's nothing more important than yer equipment when it comes to hunting, but we can chat about my new Shrapnel Blaster some other time.

Your pet must become an extension of yourself.The next task requires you to turn from the land; you will find the next creature in the waters off the coast. Across from Sen'jin Village, near the Echo Isles. look for a spirited crab called the surf crawler. Use the taming rod to tame it, then practice your skills."

South and east of here, you'll find large white cats called snow leopards. Just like an elegantly-carved rifle, behind their beautiful exterior lies a powerful fighter, capable of doing extreme damage.

6085,"Perhaps you'd like a creature that possesses little more than brute strength.

His ties to the Earthmother are strong, and you can learn much from him. Good luck, <name>."

6122,"The Cliffspring Falls in Darkshore serves as the principal source of drinking water for the region, and now I suspect it is the principal source of the poison that is harming the local fauna - deer specifically.  Use this sampler to draw some water from the mouth of the cave; be careful, as dangerous naga now reside in a cave by the falls.Once filled, deliver it to Alanndarian Nightsong in Auberdine.  She is the one that requested our aid, and you will work with her to address this malady."
6123,"The water will serve as the base of the curative salve I'll make for the deer.  For curative properties, I need some earthroot.  Herbalists know how to find it, so if we're unlucky and you aren't one then you'll need to find one to help us out.Finally for potency, I need some lunar fungus.  Finding lunar fungal blooms is easy enough; they're all over the place in caves just to the east of here.  Moonkin reside in the caves and they're irritable as of late, so be careful."
6124,"The amount of salve made out of the reagents you brought me is good enough for ten doses, <name>.  While I work with the village to try and make some more salve, I'd like for you to help us get a head start.  All around Darkshore are sickly deer; use the salve on them and cure their malaise.Dendrite Starblaze in Moonglade will want to talk to you when you're done, I'm sure.  Please extend Auberdine's thanks to the Cenarion Circle there... and let me say thanks to you directly for the help you've given!"

6127,"Dreadmist Peak to the northwest of the Crossroads is most likely a primary candidate as to the source of the spread of the poison.  Its airy peaks have pools of water that influence the weather patterns.  I suspect the water is now tainted by the demon-worshipping Burning Blade.Use this sampler to draw water from the pool at the very top of the peak.  Once filled, deliver it to Tonga Runetotem at the Crossroads.  He is the one that requested our aid, and you will work with him to address this malady."
6128,"The water will serve as the base of the curative salve I shall make for the gazelles.  For curative properties, I need some earthroot.  Herbalists know how to find it, so if you are not familiar with this skill you'll need to find one to help us out.Finally for potency, I need kodo horns - mere chips and fragments will not suffice.  Kodos you can handle wander the northern part of the Barrens; bring some down for the greater good of the balance <name>, and fetch the horns for me."

6132,"Get me out of here!I came up to the Valley of Spears to talk to the Maraudines.  I thought I could do a little business with them... but they don't want to talk!  I think they want to eat me!Get me out of here and my brother Hornizz will pay you big!  He's at our camp next to the kodo graveyard, to the east.Let's hurry, <name>.  Not two minutes ago I heard some centaurs talking about getting wood for their cookpot..."
6133,"The high elves of the Quel'Lithien lodge possesses something that belongs to me, <class>: A document detailing my life as a mortal.Before you ask; no, you most certainly are not privy to such information. Just do as I tell you, worm: Recover the registry.And imbecile, be sure to leave as much strife and grief as possible in your wake. Leave them suffering..."
6134,"There's a valley to the southeast, the Valley of Bones, haunted by Magram ghosts.  Sounds scary, doesn't it?  Well think how scary it is to the Magram!  If we captured ghost energy from that place, I bet it'd be worth plenty to those centaurs.Here, take this crate of ghost magnets.  If you place one between the two big skeletons in the valley, the Dead Goliaths, then ghosts will wander to it.  Distance yourself, take out the ghosts and get their ghost-o-plasm--that's what we'll sell to the Magram."
6135,"Up until now, you have completed the missions I have assigned; even if not in the most timely manner.I suppose you think that you are ready for a challenge. Yes... Yes, imbecile, perhaps you are ready for a more involved set of missions.The albino demon bat, Duskwing, roams the countryside just north of here. Track him down and destroy him. Return to me with a patch of his white fur and you shall be rewarded."
6136,"Past the Argent Dawn encampment of Light's Hope and west of Northdale, you will find the corpulent maggot beast, Borelgore.I've lost entire regiments to that monster. His size knows no bounds! The more he eats the greater his girth becomes...While I would not suffer any emotional harm should the beast devour you, I would prefer that you were the victor. Borelgore has been known to devour others who tried to hunt him."
6141,"My brother in arms, Brother Anton, heard rumors of an undead infestation in distant Kalimdor, in a land known as Desolace.  Anton immediately booked passage to that place, to seek and destroy the undead menace!He is looking for those with the bravery and resolve to aid him.  If your heart is true, then speak with Anton.  He is in Desolace, in the Alliance town of Nijel's Point."
6142,"You have the look of a fisherman, <class>! I love to fish - been fishing all my life. The best bait to use is soft-shelled clam meat; the fish just can't resist, you know what I mean?Up north you will find a wrecked ship off the coast. Soft-shelled clams are littered throughout the area. If you bring me back 10 pieces of soft-shelled clam meat, I will give you something in return."
6143,"Maybe you heard or maybe you haven't... my crew and I was out fishing near Ranazjar Isle, north of the wrecked ship off the coast up north. We used to fish there all the time; now all I do is think of a way to seek revenge for my fallen comrades.The naga attacked us one morning, killing everyone except me.Me conscience can't handle the guilt, <class>; I need you to go and fry them naga for me. I'll make the effort worth your while; you think you can help me with that?"
6144,"The order has come down, <class>. Varimathras himself has requested that I send my most 'capable' agents back to the Undercity for a highly sensitive tactical operation.Unfortunately, my most capable agents were killed over three years ago. In their stead I have a collection of brain dead riff-raff.<Nathanos stares coldly at you.>Travel to the Undercity at once and report to Varimathras. Do not embarrass me, <class>!"
6145,"Just as the body cannot survive without the head, the head cannot survive without the body. The defenses of the Scarlet Crusade's command inside Stratholme are almost impenetrable. We must, instead, cut the body out from under the head.My Deathstalkers have been collecting data on the activity of the Crusade outside of Stratholme. Each day, a report is sent from their central command to Tyr's Hand. This report is the key, <race>! Find the Crimson Courier and recover that report. Return it to Nathanos."
6146,"I have made some adjustments to this command. Should our little ruse work, they will expose the Scarlet Oracle and we shall strike!Now pay attention, <class>. You are to deliver this command to the Crusader Lord, Valdelmar.How? You are going to hand it to him, imbecile.Take the command and this rotten apple to Tyr's Hand. When you cross into the city, eat the apple. You will transform into something more... palatable to the humans. Take the command and hand it to the Crusader Lord, Valdelmar."
6147,"The Grand Crusader makes an unusual request. Hrm, regardless... what he asks will be done. Return to the Scarlet Bastion and notify him that the Oracle will be en route shortly.We will take every precaution to ensure that she makes it to Stratholme unharmed."
6148,"Demetria is chief advisor to the Grand Crusader. She is called the Oracle due to her 'otherworldly' senses. She has successfully assisted the Crusade in several of their victories against the Scourge.While this ruse was successful in exposing her, if she truly does possess psychic powers, she will undoubtedly be expecting some sort of trouble. You are going to provide that 'trouble.'Track down the Oracle and terminate her. They should be moving out of Tyr's Hand as we speak. Make me proud, worm."
6161,"Rackmore's log tells of how his ship was sailing for Feathermoon Stronghold when it was attacked by seafaring creatures.  To prevent his treasure from falling into enemy hands, he hid his chest on Ranazjar Isle.To open the chest requires two keys, a silver and a gold.  These keys were lost, but if the keys and the chest are found, a treasure awaits!"
6162,"My husband traveled Felwood for the honor of our clan, doing battle against the Shadow Council and other corrupt atrocities!After he escaped death numerous times, I received a letter from him saying that a druid asked him for help against a great befouled furbolg named Overlord Ror--the two were never heard from again.I want this Ror's clawed hand, <name>. I want it to pay for leaving me a widow! I believe the creature is to the south... near the Ashenvale border."
6163,"I was overwhelmed. On this very stead, I stood... held my ground in defense of Lordaeron. The farm and all on it were waylaid by a gigantic wave of Scourge.The wretch. The filth. It hovered above me, entrails hanging from its gaping chest cavity.I woke as Scourge. For so long I was helpless. My mind had coalesced with the Lich King's.She came for me... somewhere, somehow, I knew she would. Free.And now, I must have my vengeance - my vengeance on that which took from me my life. Destroy it."
6164,"I'm ready for business!  What you do want?Oh wait... I can't open up shop without my receipt book.  How am I to keep track of things without my receipt book?I must have left it in town somewhere.  I had a room in the inn... the book must be there.Bring me my book.  Please, bring it to me!  Bring me my book and you'll see!  I'll set up shop and you'll see that my prices are INSANE!"
6181,"Although we don't get much aid from Stormwind directly, I do have a contact in the city who helps supply us with armor.  His name is Osric Strang.  His shop, Limited Immunity, is in the Old Town of Stormwind.Our supply of armor dwindles, and I must contact Osric for more.  Can you take him this note?The fastest way to Stormwind is through Thor, our gryphon master.  He's just down the hill; bring him my note, and then take a gryphon to Stormwind."
6182,"Nathanos Marris was the first and last of the human ranger lords. A disciple of Sylvanas Windrunner, now the Banshee Queen of the Forsaken.We had thought that Nathanos had been killed in action in the defense of Lordaeron five years ago. Although his corpse was never recovered, it was assumed that he did not make it out of the Eastern Plaguelands.Mathias Shaw has been investigating the disappearance and may have some new information. Report to him at once. He resides in Old Town, at the Barracks."
6183,"Five of my best field agents were assigned the Marris case. One returned, only to end up dead in his sleep three days later.What little information we did manage to get out of him was incoherent gibberish. We made out two words: ""Nathanos,"" and ""Blightcaller.""I do not have the available manpower to continue this investigation and Ravenholdt will not assist us. We must get to the bottom of this; if only to provide closure to the families of the deceased. Will you help?"
6184,"The only information we have thus far, then, is that Nathanos Marris may have been slain by this Blightcaller. We assume the Blightcaller is the same fiend that disposed of my agents.Flint Shadowmore, another SI:7 operative, is stationed at the Alliance encampment of Chillwind Point in the Western Plaguelands. Seek him out; he will debrief you on the current situation in the Plagues and give you an assignment.Good luck, <name>."
6185,"As I said, your first mission is one of reconnaissance. Nothing fancy, <name>. You must travel to the Eastern Plaguelands and look for any clues as to this Blightcaller.Be on the lookout for information about our missing operatives. We have to assume that they are dead and if they are dead, they must have a corpse... somewhere.<Flint swallows hard.>All SI:7 agents carry this insignia.<Flint shows you his SI:7 insignia.>Bring any of those that you may find back to me."
6186,"<The blood appears to have completely drained from Flint's face.>Na... Nathanos did this? Nathanos is the Blightcaller?Why? He was... was so noble - a ranger lord respected by all. The only human ever allowed to train under the high elves. Now a ruthless agent of the Forsaken?I... I am sorry to ask this of you, <name>, but Highlord Fordragon must be informed of this turn of events at once. Please, return to Stormwind and deliver the news."
6187,"Do you know how many ranger lords exist in this world? How many human ranger lords have ever existed?Nathanos' accomplishments were unprecedented. He was a tactical genius, responsible for Alliance victories spanning a decade of conflict.And now... the champion of the Forsaken.No. This cannot be. Order must be restored.Gather an army, <name>. Return to the Plagues with your army and destroy the Blightcaller.I wish you luck, <name>. Truly, you will need it for this battle."
6261,"<name>, I gathered into this crate everything Lewis asked for.  Can you take it to him?If you've already spoken to Thor in Westfall, then you can take a gryphon back to him.  Dungar Longdrink is our gryphon master, over in the trade district.Speak with Dungar, then get this crate to Lewis as fast as you can.  We don't want our fighting men and women in Westfall to go without fresh equipment!"
6281,"For a small fee, you can take a gryphon to Stormwind, so you can deliver Lewis' note to Osric.  You won't get there faster any other way.If that sounds acceptable, then just speak to me again when you're ready for the ride.  I'll charge you a little, but trust me; it'll be worth it!"
6282,"Tauren take pride as the protector of these lands. Undoubtedly you can guess why I am alarmed with the number of harpies that dwell here in Stonetalon.The Bloodfuries are the source of the increasing number of harpies in Kalimdor; they encroach upon all likes of life preventing the innocent from leaving their boundaries.I need you to cull the harpies, <name>!"
6283,"Limiting the number of Bloodfury Harpies will not be enough. The only true cure for their disease would be to slay their leader, Bloodfury Ripper!She is all but a queen to those filthy creatures. Slay her and their numbers will surely diminish.Go back into the Charred Vale and you will find her along the western hills. She will not be easy to vanquish, but the reward will be great."
6284,Warning: Proceed into Sishir Canyon west of here at your own risk.Besseleth and her eight-legged children of the forest have claimed this canyon as their webbed lair.Maggran Earthbinder in Sun Rock Retreat has placed a bounty on Besseleth. Slay her and bring proof of your killing to Maggran; there you will receive your reward for disposing this eight-legged menace.
6285,"The gryphon master in Westfall is Thor.  If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my gryphons to him.That's a good lesson to know: gryphons are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote gryphon master after you've already been there.You've already been to Thor, so just speak with me again when you're ready to take a gryphon to Westfall.  Once there, you can deliver Osric's Crate to Quartermaster Lewis."
6301,"Industrial greed and continuous war have wrecked the lands of Stonetalon. Only the blessings of the Earthmother can cure such injury.<name>, I will require you to seek a special seed, the Gaea seed. They are only found here in Stonetalon Mountain, north of Sun Rock Retreat at Mirkfallon Lake, near the water's edge.Once you bring me the seeds I will imbue them with shamanistic power to speed their growth."
6321,"Executor Hadrec asked me to take stock of our equipment at the Sepulcher.  With the Scourge, and worse, lurking in the woods, he doesn't want the Deathguards to lack gear they might need.I found that we are, in general, well stocked, but we do need more weapons to replace those lost in the field.Here is a requisition order of what is needed, for the weapon dealer Gordon Wendham in the Undercity.  Take the order to our bat master, Karos Razok, and speak with him about transport to the Undercity."
6322,"I have placed the Sepulcher's supplies into this crate.  If you have already visited the Sepulcher and spoken with their bat master, then you may ride a bat back to him.Speak with the Undercity's bat master, Michael Garrett.  He can provide you with a bat to the Sepulcher."
6323,"One of my bats can take you to the Undercity, for a small fee.  Speak with me again when you are ready so that we may arrange your transport.You will find Gordon Wendham in the Trade Quarter of the Undercity.  That is the same quarter where my bat will land."
6324,"The bat master in the Sepulcher is Karos Razok.  If you have already met him, then I can give you a bat to fly back to him.Our bats will always fly to the Undercity, but to travel to more remote locales their rider must first visit the area and speak with its bat master.You have met Karos in the Sepulcher, so you may now fly bats there.  Speak with me again when you are ready."
6341,"The fishermen of Rut'theran village do very well, for the fish here are extremely large and abundant.  I would like to compare the bounty here with that of the mainland.I have a collection of fish bones and scales that I would like taken to a colleague of mine in Darkshore.  His name is Laird, he is a fish vendor in the village of Auberdine.Bring my collection to our hippogryph master, Vesprystus, and speak to him about traveling to Auberdine."
6342,"From Rut'theran, there are two methods of travel to Auberdine: by ferry and by hippogryph.  Both are quick and reliable, but if you have not yet flown to Auberdine by hippogryph, then I suggest you do.It is sound advice to speak with the hippogryph master in every town that has one.  Once you speak to the master, you can then fly there from other towns.Here is Nessa's collection.  Speak with me again when you are ready to fly to Auberdine and deliver Nessa's collection to Laird."
6343,"I must send a response to Nessa.  She'll be very interested to know how different the fish here are from those along Teldrassil's coastline.  We can only guess the cause, but it is my suspicion that the world tree itself is affecting the wildlife around it!Please, take this response to Nessa.  If you wish to take a hippogryph back to Rut'theran then speak with the hippogryph master Caylais Moonfeather.  If you wish to take the ferry, then one regularly departs from the dock to the northwest."
6344,"A friend of mine, Nessa Shadowsong, is a fishing merchant in Rut'theran Village.  She needs a parcel taken to Darkshore, and is looking for someone to help her.If you're interested, then to reach Nessa you must take the portal in Darnassus to Rut'theran Village.  You will find the portal west of the Temple Gardens."
6361,"I have a bundle of hides from the animals of the Barrens, and must get them to Thunder Bluff.  A colleague there, Ahanu, will use the hides to create leather goods.Will you take the hides to him for me?The quickest way to Thunder Bluff is on the back of a wind rider.  Bring the bundle of hides to Devrak, our wind rider master in the Crossroads, and speak to him about transport to Thunder Bluff."
6362,"For a small fee, I will give you a wind rider to Thunder Bluff.  There's no faster way to the city!If that is acceptable, speak to me again when you are ready to go.If you're taking those hides to Ahanu, then I think he's at Hewa's Armory, at the base of the wind rider tower in Thunder Bluff.  And that's right where you'll land!"
6363,"I have prepared leather goods for Jahan to sell at the Crossroads.  Will you bring them to him?If you have already been to the Crossroads and spoken to their wind rider master, then you can fly one of our Thunder Bluff wind riders back to him.Take the leather goods to Tal, our wind rider master in Thunder Bluff, and speak with him to arrange transport to the Crossroads."
6364,"In order to fly to a town, you must have already been there and spoken with the wind rider master of that town.  You have been to the Crossroads and spoken to their wind rider master Devrak, so for a small fee you can take a wind rider to him from here.Speak with me again when you are ready.  Once at the Crossroads, you can then deliver the leather goods to Jahan Hawkwing."
6365,"I have some choice cuts of meat that I want to send to a friend.  Her name is Gryshka, the innkeeper in Orgrimmar.  Will you deliver the meat for me?The fastest way to Orgrimmar is on a wind rider.  Take the meats to the Crossroads wind rider master, Devrak, and speak with him about transport to Orgrimmar."
6381,"As you have seen, <class>, though the land is in pain, the cycle of life is a powerful thing. Now we must do our part help it along. You must plant these seeds at the center of the destruction, to the west, in the Charred Vale. Beware, for harpies and angry fire elementals still plague the scarred land.<name>, take these enchanted Gaea seeds and plant them in fertile mounds of soil. The cycle of life must go on!"
6382,"Your strength impresses me, <class>.  Your willingness to embrace the hunt gives me confidence that you could move on to bigger game... and bigger challenges.The forests of Ashenvale represent a vast untamed wild that the Horde seeks to impose its own will upon, both politically and spiritually.  If you seek to prove yourself in an unproven land, seek the guidance of Senani Thunderheart in Splintertree Post.  The outpost is due north of the path leading from the Barrens."
6384,"For just a few coins I will have a wind rider bring you to Orgrimmar.  When you get there, you can take Zargh's Meats to Gryshka.  Her inn is in the Valley of Strength, not far from the Skytower, where my wind rider will drop you off.Speak with me again when you are ready for the journey."
6385,"I've written a letter of thanks to Zargh.  Will you deliver it for me?  If you've already been to the Crossroads and spoken with their wind rider master, then you can fly a wind rider back there.Take my letter to Doras, the wind rider master of Orgrimmar, and speak with him about transport to the Crossroads."
6386,"My wind riders are trained to fly to many different places, as long as you have already been to that place and spoken with the wind rider master there.You have been to the Crossroads and spoken to their wind rider master Devrak, so now you can fly directly to him from here.  Once you're at the Crossroads, you can deliver Gryshka's letter to Zargh.Speak with me when you are ready to go."
6387,"I see a lot of young dwarves at my door, eager to learn the trade of mining.  And if there's one thing a miner needs more than anything, it's a pick!I have a list of mining students who scored high in their lessons and earned an honorary pick.  Take my list to Golnir Bouldertoe in Ironforge.  He'll get the picks ready.The fastest way to Ironforge is on a gryphon, so bring the list to our gryphon master, Thorgrum Borrelson, and speak with him about transport to Ironforge."
6388,"Here are the honorary picks for Brock's students.  If you've already been to Thelsamar, then you should fly a gryphon back there!Take the picks to our gryphon master, Gryth Thurden, and speak with him about a ride back to Thelsamar."
6389,You look around the lumber mill for something suitable to open the barrel with. You find a crowbar that looks like it will do the trick.You set your feet and pray that you'll be able to get out of the mill before the termites get to you.

6391,"For just a few coins, one of my gryphons will take you to Ironforge.  From there, deliver Brock's list to Golnir Bouldertoe.  You'll find him in the Deep Mountain Mining Guild.  That's in the Great Forge District of Ironforge, which is right where my gryphon will drop you off!Speak to me again when you're ready for the journey."
6392,"For a small fee you can buy a gryphon ride to Thelsamar... as long as you've already been there.  Gryphons will only fly you to places you've already been, so be sure to speak with every gryphon master you see so you can fly to him later.You've already been to Thorgrum, the gryphon master of Thelsamar, so now you can return to him.  And once in Thelsamar, you can deliver the picks to Brock Stoneseeker.Speak with me when you're ready to go."
6393,"The Tribunal of the Tides has sent me to wage war on the fire elementals here in Stonetalon Mountain. Neptulon the Tidehunter, Lord of all water elementals, has taken a personal interest in seeing our fiery cousins extinguished.<name>, you can help me gain favor with the Tribunal by destroying the fire elementals in Charred Vale. When destroyed, the fire elementals leave Incendrites. Return these to me and be rewarded."
6394,"<name>, you are a dependable <race>.  Can I count on you for another task?Some time ago I was surveying the cave to the north for minerals, and I left my favorite pick behind.  When I later returned to retrieve it I found the cave was filled with vicious beasts!  Will you go into the cave, the Burning Blade Coven, and get my pick?I left it in a chamber with waterfalls.  My pick has a spell on it so you can see it in the dark, so you won't have to worry about finding it... just what's guarding it!"
6395,"My friend Marla Fipps lived with her husband Samuel before the plague, but when the plague came Samuel succumbed and joined the Scourge's ranks.Marla was spared an undeath only to die at the hands of her now mindless husband.  So strong was her love, however, that her last dying wish was to be buried with her beloved Samuel.Samuel Fipps roams at a ruined camp along the road northeast of Deathknell.  Defeat him and grant Marla's wish: bury him at her grave, in the first row of our graveyard."
6401,"Tell Tammra Windfield, Kaya's aunt who's at Sun Rock Retreat, about the good news! Kaya is alive! We had thought she was lost after the brutal attack on our village. Follow the path to the west to get to Sun Rock Retreat."
6402,"You are to meet with Windsor at the gates of Stormwind.What Windsor is about to unveil will shake the very foundation of the kingdom!Do not attempt to venture there alone, <name>. You must amass an army! Gather your compatriots. To arms!"
6403,"It has been quite the adventure, friend. I owe you a great debt of gratitude. Perhaps, when all is said and done...As you have no doubt ascertained by now, Lady Prestor is Onyxia: Brood of Deathwing, twin to the tyrant of the Spire, Nefarian.For too long she has held our kingdom in her captivating gaze. Even the Highlord is controlled by her trickery - a puppet. It all ends today... The spell will be broken.Worry not, for together, we shall be victorious!Are you ready?"
6421,"Something is amiss here in Stonetalon. Can you feel the tension in the air, <name>?Southeast of here lies a deep cave in Boulderslide Ravine. The kobolds there are frantically mining a rare crystal called Resonite. I need you to bring back some ore samples so that I can understand what's happening in that cave.  I also need you to investigate the depth of that cave.Go young <class>, it's imperative I know what evil lurks under these mountains."
6441,"Heya! I've been traveling through Ashenvale, heading towards Ratchet, and decided to make a stop here at Splintertree. I'm always looking for an opportunity, and it seems that satyr horns are in high demand in Ratchet these days.After asking around here, it seems that the satyrs in Night Run, Satyrnaar, and Xavian all have the type of horns I am looking for. I'm no match for those satyrs... but you look like you might be!Tell you what, you collect the horns for me and I'll make it worth your time."
6442,"There is evil lurking here along the coast, <race>.It is the resting place of the doomed city of Zoram, long destroyed and submerged beneath the seas.  Lost, and nearly forgotten.Now, the naga have returned, and for what reason we do not know.  But reason matters little; we must defend the land we have worked so hard to claim as our own.Return to me with 20 of their heads! Throw the naga back to the depths!"
6461,"We Trolls here at Malaka'Jin have prospered from the land; Stonetalon Mountain offers great hunting for us to live on.Lately, we have attracted the wrong dinner guests... the spiders in these mountains have been raiding our camps at night looking to steal our hunt.If you were to help us kill off these ghastly beasts we at Malaka'Jin would be in your debt. Spiders are everywhere in Stonetalon - just head north from here and you will see what I am talking about."
6462,"My kinfolk were traveling here with many sacred troll charms, but the Thistlefur furbolgs attacked and killed them before they reached Zoram'gar!  Those vile Furbolgs!I miss my brothers and sisters who were killed, but we will meet again in the afterlife.  However, their troll charms hold great value in this world.  It is an outrage that the furbolgs have them!<name>, you must retrieve the charms!  They are in chests in Thistlefur Hold, a cave at the end of Thistlefur Village, north of Astranaar."
6481,"You have uncovered a dark threat to the land, <class>. The Resonite cask you have found in that cave houses a slumbering Earthen by the name of Goggeroc.I have changed the mixture of the Resonite crystals that you gathered with my shamanistic powers. Take the enchanted Resonite crystal and smash open the Resonite cask, which houses the Earthen.When awakened, Goggeroc will be weakened... Slay him, <name>!"
6482,"Eh?  Who are you?<name>?  You're no furbolg.  They are cursed!  They thought I was a bear and captured me, and now they starve me!  My strength is failing...Help me escape, then speak with my sister Yama at the Splintertree Post to the east.<name>! I must escape!"
6501,"A fragment of the shattered medallion is all that I can offer.You must find another of dragon blood willing to assist you in forging a new key. Once you secure this key, you must travel to the Wyrmbog in Dustwallow Marsh. It is there that you will find her lair, <name>.Where to find other flights willing to help? Sadly, I do not know... They are said to exist. Some may even work and live among us, disguised as one of the humanoid races. I wish you luck."
6502,"It is a piece of the dragon; a scale - enchanted and transformed. Whole, it could have granted access to the beast's lair. Shattered, it is useless.It is possible to repair the item, but to do so would require the blood of a black dragon champion. There is one... He is known as General Drakkisath, ruler of the dragonspawn armies of Nefarian. Perhaps you have heard of him?Return with his blood, <race>, and I shall enchant the fragment into something that will grant you access to Onyxia's lair."
6503,"We received reports that Ashenvale outrunners left Silverwing Outpost not long ago, and now sneak near our territories in the forest.  We don't want them gathering intelligence on our defenses!Sneak through the forests south of our post here and east of the Alliance outpost of Silverwing.  Find and slay the outrunners, then return to me."
6504,"I just picked up this shredder from Ratchet and I was on my way back to the Warsong Lumber Camp, where I am supposed to be on duty. I was given a manual on how to operate the shredder, but on the trip back, a huge gust of wind blew it from my hands. The pages went everywhere, and all I was left with was the cover.The pages could be just about anywhere by now, I suppose... but I don't know how to use the shredder without them! Will you find them for me?"
6521,"Malcin claims he is outside Razorfen Downs. This ambassador must be slain--his mission a failure in the eyes of the Lich King.His presence there does explain much of what we've discovered about the area--some of the quilboar have grown frightfully powerful while showing signs of the Plague in their own way. Truly that must be a sign of some sort of deal they've struck.Find Malcin and slay him, <name>. Return to me after the deed is done."
6522,"My Lady,You know very well what it is we are offering. The opportunity for you to take the Barrens and the lands beyond is a great one. We simply want your aid in return. By aid we mean nothing more than your giving us the freedom to take action in the area.Please, allow us to discuss this further. We have great power and are willing to share with those wise enough to join us. I will remain outside Razorfen Downs for the time being.Best Regards,Ambassador Malcin"
6523,"Thank you for rescuing me! We must leave quickly before they discover that I am free. Please escort me to Camp Aparaje. From there, I know my way.My father, Makaba Flathoof, will be desperate to know that I am safe."
6541,"Have you ever been to Ashenvale, to the north? The horde has recently set up an outpost on the Zoram Strand there, and we can always use some new recruits to help defend our new fronts.If you think you are up to it, see Kadrak in the northern Barrens, at the watch tower. He is heading up the Ashenvale campaign and can give you further orders."

He is heading up the Ashenvale campaign and can give you further orders."
6543,"I recently deployed a few scouts into Ashenvale and I need a runner to take them their orders, and bring me back a report of what they have observed.Your first stop should be the Zoram'gar Outpost, along the coast to the west, at the Zoram Strand, to locate the first runner. You also need to stop at Splintertree Post, to the north, and along the road to the east, near Azshara. You will find a scout and an outrider there.Give them each a report, and from them, get an update on their findings."
6544,"Hey!  <class>!  Come here!My raiders and I are about to attack the Silverwing Outpost to the west.  Our target is its leader, Duriel Moonfire.  Scouts report the outpost is defended heavily with sentinels and warriors.  The battle will be glorious!Do you want to share in the glory, <name>, and aid us?  If so, then when it's over you can report our success to my superior, Ertog Ragetusk in Splintertree.What do you say.  Are you with us?"
6548,"The Grimtotem Clan raided my village and killed most everyone. I killed all I could, but barely escaped with my life.<name>, all I wish now is that more of them are dead. You will find them just to the west of here."
6561,"Strength has left me. Your help is needed!Long ago this site was a great temple of Elune. But misfortune led to ruin when the corruption of an Old God seeped up from beneath the earth and tainted the sacred Moon Well.Aku'Mai, servant of the Old God, rose from the waters.The Twilight's Hammer cultists have allied with the naga to occupy these grounds. The cultists, led by Kelris, sacrifice innocents to Aku'Mai for power.Slay Kelris and bring his head to Bashana in Thunder Bluff, <name>, please."
6562,"Je'neu Sancrea is in need of aid. He is at the Zoram'gar Outpost in Ashenvale. The Night elf forest is to the north of the Stonetalon mountains. You can reach it by traveling through Windshear Crag or by heading north through Barrens. Zoram Strand is far to the west of the forest. Be careful, <name>. There are forces there that will not take to your presence kindly."
6563,"Within the beginning tunnels of Blackfathom Deeps, large sapphire clusters can be found along the cave walls. Recently it was noted that the naga were harvesting the crystals. Until it can be discerned why, I sense we should stop the naga from succeeding. The crystals have great elemental power and if used inappropriately, could make for a powerful arcane component.Will you help me, <name>? Blackfathom Deeps can be found along Zoram Strand to the north of our outpost."
6564,"Some poor handwriting is scrawled on the crumpled up note:""Yes, tell all the priestesses to bring the crystals to me. The water elemental spirits are strong within them and they will aid our aquamancers greatly in their own summonings.By controlling the power within the crystals, we will appease Aku'Mai. One day we will have enough power to bring Aku'Mai back to us and the world will return to its greatest era! An era of rule by the Old Gods!"""
6565,"This Twilight's Hammer follower cannot be allowed to complete his plan. The Twilight's Hammer do not understand the spirits of nature. They believe in the Old Gods--creatures of chaos and destruction that were long ago defeated. This Lorgus cannot be allowed to succeed. You must stop him, <name>. I cannot do it myself--I am too weak.Go into Blackfathom Deeps, find him, and kill him. Return to me here at Zoram'gar when it's done."
6566,"It is good to see you again, <name>. The wind carries with it news from the Eastern Kingdom.Sit, listen."
6567,"I have received word from one of my champions that a way into the lair of the dragon may exist. You are to seek him out.Rexxar wanders the desert wasteland of Desolace, traveling between Stonetalon and Feralas. He awaits your arrival.Rexxar wanders the road from Feralas to Stonetalon Peak, except he cuts north from the area with the demons and goes through the Kodo Graveyard, before taking the road north out of there (or south into there). He also wanders slightly into Stonetalon Peak and Feralas (as far as The Twin Colossals in Feralas) so if you're having no luck finding him, search a little into both zones."
6568,"What do you know of illusions, <name>? For you see, it is an illusion that you must create in order to circumvent the Black Flight's defenses.I know of one that may be willing to assist you in your quest of deception. She has assisted our kind in the past when she has deemed the cause worthy.In the Western Plaguelands you will find Myranda the Hag, master illusionist - an exile of the Lordaeron alliance. Travel there and take with you this message."
6569,"So the <race> wishes to become one of the Black Flight, eh?The creation of the illusion you require is trivial, but the components required for the divination are quite difficult to obtain. The Warchief has entrusted you with this mission, so Myranda must assume you as capable.Travel to the upper citadel of Blackrock Spire and slay enough of the black dragonspawn to fill up one of your packs with their eyes.Return to Myranda when you have gathered enough of the reagent."
6570,"I have attuned this medallion with the magic necessary to create and maintain an illusion within the bounds of the den of Emberstrife.Emberstrife is an ancient drake; an old gatekeeper of Nefarian, burdened with the duty to test those dragonspawn that would ascend to the rank of elite guard to Onyxia.Travel to the Wyrmbog of Dustwallow Marsh and enter the lair of Emberstrife. Once there, put on the amulet and follow where your destiny may lead!"
6571,"We are in short supply of a few items at the Warsong lumber camp!Pixel at Splintertree Post has our shipment of saw blades. It'll take a trip to Booty Bay to pick up a crate of axes from Wharfmaster Lozgil.Our shipment of oil and rope will be more difficult. The rope was pilfered by the Thistlefur and Foulweald furbolgs, and the satyrs intercepted the delivery of the oil and are now using it for detestable rituals in Night Run, Satyrnaar, and Xavian!Can you help me?"
6582,"We are Deathwing's children, whelp. Our dominance over the lesser Aspects must be enforced.If you are truly worthy of ascension, the lesser dragonflight will wilt in your presence.Find their champions and lay waste to them in the name of our Father!Travel to Winterspring and track down the mighty blue drake, Scryer. Crush him and any of the Blue Flight that stand in your path. Tear out his skull and return it to me."
6583,"Just as our Father crushes the Aspects themselves, so too must we strive to bring chaos and destruction to their children.You must test your battle prowess against the sleepless dreamers: The children of the Green Flight.Travel to the Swamp of Sorrows and track down Somnus, drake champion of the Green Flight. Let flow your hatred; dominate the insect... Return to me with his skull..."
6584,"The time watchers, children of Nozdormu - Lord of the Centuriesss...It is three that guard the Caverns of Time, but only one that holds the interests of the Black Flight: The Time Shifter, Chronalis, favored drakeling of Nozdormu.Ssstrike at this champion, a blow to make even the stoic sands of time weep. Return to me with his skull."
6585,"It was over the mountains of Grim Batol that our Father raged against the combined might of the Aspects. The cowardly act of the betrayer, Alexstrasza, bought the other Aspects enough time to escape from Father's wrath.Sssuch a shameful act...The Red Flight now guards Grim Batol, their lieutenant, Axtroz, must be destroyed. Return the skull of Axtroz to me. For Father, whelp!"
6601,"From the skulls of our enemies is shaped a medallion. You know this medallion, yesss? You have no doubt seen it worn by your elders.Take it, whelp. Return to the Spire and present it to General Drakkisath. The General will place the final enchantment upon the medallion, attuning the trinket to your spirit.You will wear the finished medallion as a badge of honor, symbolizing your ascension to one of our most guarded ranks: Guardian to the brood mother.Go!"
6602,"You will pay the General a visit, yes, but not as one of the Black Dragonflight.You see, a ceremony is merely another term for blood letting to the Black Flight.The latent amulet merely needs the blood of the General in order to become active. One of their crude failsafe mechanisms.Return to Blackrock Spire and destroy Drakkisath. Bring his blood back here and I shall activate the key to Onyxia's lair."
6603,"There's trouble in Winterspring!Why, sure, I spend some time out in the wilds and know about these things... I'm always mighty proud to say it. I consider the hours I spend out there in the hills to be golden. Help you cultivate quick reflexes, a cool head and a keen eye...It takes judgement, brains and maturity to appreciate the wilderness in the way that I do.Now, what was I talking about?Ah yes, trouble. See Donova Snowden at the hot springs and she can tell you more."
6604,"Have you noticed the abandoned camp to the south of here? It looks like the wildkin went crazy and destroyed just about everything they could find!I heard a rumor that one of the survivors of the attack is resting at Starfall Village, west of here. I'm sure curious about what happened... aren't you?"
6605,"I just got back from Felwood, <name>. On my way through, I stopped at Bloodvenom Post and I met a very odd character... She seemed intent on one thing, and I suppose I could tell you what that is, but I think she'd like to explain it to you herself.If you're interested, head to Bloodvenom Post in western Felwood and look for Winna Hazzard.Who knows, she might need your help..."
6606,"We can always use a little luck, eh? A small advantage is all it takes to turn things in your favor...I happened to make the acquaintance of a rather eccentric witch doctor some time back. She made me a lucky charm... for a price. Believe me, though, it was well worth it!Maybe you'd be interested in one of your own? Find Witch Doctor Mau'ari in Everlook. I'm not giving mine up!"
6607,"Can't say I really enjoy fishin' much. Figure I been at it for a good 20 or 30 years now.I reckon people are driven to do what they do for different reasons.Now, I'm not saying you need to fish for 30 years or catch every fish in the sea to become a master fisherman. I reckon you just need to be determined - determined enough to sit on your duff for hours at a time, doin' nothin'.I'll tell you what, catch me a few rare fish and I'll teach you a thing or two. Here's a list:"
6608,"Lumak no can teach <name> no more. You too good! Find Lumak friend, Nat Pagle. Is human but no eat! Is Lumak friend! Nat teach you fish gooder.You find Nat in Dustwallow Marsh, south of Humie town, Thermorosomethinglikedat. Nat probably fishing. Go now!"
6609,"I'm a dwarf fer cryin' out loud, < lad/missy>! I ain't been designed to fish! I mean look at me! I'm practically made outta stone.I got nothin' left - ye tapped me out. I've taught ye all I know, flipflop!Don't ye get it? Ah, fine. I got an ol' friend over on Kalimdor who can help ye out. 'Is name be Nat Pagle, a fine lad. Find him on the islands south o' Theramore. Git goin'!"
6610,"Ever heard of a clamlette? Of course you haven't! It's my latest and greatest culinary masterpiece. Oh, <name>, just thinking about a clamlette makes my mouth water.Unfortunately, I'm all out of supplies to make any! How about I make you a deal? You gather the supplies I need to make a clamlette and I'll teach you the finer points of exotic cuisine and I'll even throw in a couple of clamlettes to boot! Deal??Here's what I need:"
6611,"How you expect Zamja teach you anything? You got all of Zamja's cooking mojo and still you crave more!Zamja can't help. Fat <race> needs to go to Gadgetzan. You find a little goblin named Dirge there - he help you, fatty.When you become big cook on the block, you come back and teach Zamja, ok? Now go!"
6612,"I can tell by yer cooking spoon that ye know what yer doin'. Unfortunately, I can't teach ya nothin'.Luckily fer ye, I know a guy. He's a goblin and probably the best cook on Kalimdor.Ayep, that's the bad news, < lad/missy> - ye got to travel to Kalimdor. Git to Gadgetzan and find Dirge Quikcleave. He'll set ya straight."
6621,"<name>, another tribe of Furbolgs,  the Foulweald, live southeast of Astranaar.  They are not as many as the Thistlefur, but their ferocity poses a future threat.  With a show of force, we can remove that threat.Take this banner, go to the Foulweald village and place it on their totem mound.  They will try to destroy the banner, but hold your ground until their chief, Murgut, appears to save face for the tribe.  Bring me the totem he carries.Gather your allies, <name>.  This is no task for a single <class>."
6622,"Good day, doctor. You will be tested on your ability to triage patients accordingly this afternoon. Should you pass your examination, you will join the prestigious ranks of Horde Trauma.Now pay attention! The critically injured must be tended to first. After the criticals come the badly injured. The injured should be tended to last. You must save 15 patients to pass this exam. You will fail should 6 of your patients die in triage.Triage bandages will be supplied.Good luck, doctor."
6623,"Doctor <name>, I presume. It is a pleasure to see you again.I have some wonderful news for you! Doctor Gregory Victor, chief physician of Horde Trauma has made a personal request for you to join him at Hammerfall. This could be the opportunity of a lifetime! I would give anything to be given a chance to study under the great Doctor Gregory Victor! Do not squander this opportunity!"

6626,"The Forsaken do not pass on their... illness... from what I have seen. This diplomat seems to be granting undeath to would-be followers. I am beginning to think he is one of the Scourge.For now, my concern is not with him though, it's with the growing ranks around him. They creep from the shadows daily, almost begging him for more power.I'm not powerful enough to fight them on my own, <name>. What do you say? Are you up for some hunting?"
6627,"You have brought me the book, and now it is time for your question. Are you ready?Time is not an issue, <class>, so do not feel pressured. You may take as long as you like to answer."
6628,"So the time is once again upon us. As a student of lore, you have shown great tenacity by undertaking my task.And so now I offer you your question. If you are ready, speak to me again, and take all the time you need, <name>--there is no pressure to answer quickly."
6629,"<name>, you've done a fine job killing Grimtotem. If you dare, Grundig Darkcloud and his personal band of brutes is by far the worst of the lot. He was the one who led the brutal attack on my village.You will find him in Grimtotem Post a bit further up the path to the west. Kill him, and I will be forever grateful."
6641,"Vorsha the Lasher... the fiendish hydra that roams the seas...She has attacked our outpost, each time unprovoked, laying waste to anything that falls in her path.But I am ready, <name>. I have prepared to best the hydra and end these attacks on Zoram'gar.The naga honor the wicked nature of this beast with a brazier that remains lit on an island just off the coast. I believe that if we put it out, Vorsha will appear in anger.We will need help, so be sure to bring some strong allies."
6661,Avast ye scallywag. Arrrr... Arrrr ye looking fer work? We gots a serious rat problem down here an' not enough hands on the poop deck.What do ye say? All ye needs to do is take this here rat catchin' flute and play the melody around the vermin.

6681,"<name>,Ravenholdt has taken an interest in you, young thief. We have been watching. Your style is a bit awkward but nothing we couldn't fix.Should you be prepared to embark on a career as a disciple of Master Ravenholdt and member of the Assassin's League, you have only to bring the Seal of Ravenholdt (attached to this letter) to Ravenholdt Manor.Your first task is to find the manor, hidden away in the hills of Hillsbrad and demonstrate your cunning.Regards,Fahrad"
6721,"Hello, young hunter. You look to me like you are skilled enough to handle a beast and train it as your companion.You must see Dazalar in Dolanaar. He can put you on the path to earning a pet of your own."

6761,"I have relegated my second, Mathrengyl Bearwalker, to deal with Moonglade's call for aid.  Speak to him on this matter - NOT me.Let me give you some... friendly... advice.  It is I who led us out of the darkness - NOT the Cenarion Circle in Moonglade - when all was lost for our race.  Teldrassil gives us all new life!  They would have you believe otherwise, and to believe their propaganda would be a fool's task.I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not you're a fool."
6762,"For this task, Keeper Remulos' majordomo in Moonglade - Rabine Saturna - seeks aid in exploring the vast wastelands far to the west of Tanaris... and even further west of Un'Goro.  You should find him in Nighthaven, the main village of Moonglade.While your work will no doubt be of tremendous benefit to us all, I advise you to tread gingerly.  There are tensions between Darnassus and Moonglade... ones that may grow over the course of time."
6804,"A force of elemental scouts was sent to the eastern plaguelands of Lordaeron, and the disease of that place twisted and infected them.  The Waterlords cannot allow this affront to our purity!Take this vial.  In it is a quantity of one aspect of Neptulon.  If used on the plagued elementals it will fight the poison within their bodies and cure them!  But their inner conflict will drive them into a surging madness.Defeat the discordant surges and bring me their bracers of binding."
6805,"We, the elementals of water, wage war with those beings of the lesser elements.  If you are truly our ally in this conflict, then show me your conviction!Far to the south, in the desert land of Silithus, the servants of air and earth scurry in a corner of rock named the Crystal Vale.  They protect items of power from smaller beings, mortals, and although I do not know why they do this, I wish to foil their efforts.Go to the Crystal Vale in Silithus and defeat our enemies, then return to me."
6821,"You have shown me that you can defeat our enemies and perform missions to further the cause of the Waterlords.  But until now you have only faced lesser foes... if pitted against a powerful enemy, can you prevail?That is your new task.High up in Blackrock Spire the orcs have captured a servant of fire, the Pyroguard Emberseer.  Find his place of imprisonment, slay his captors, and then slay the emberseer.  Bring me his eye and it will show me your worth."
6822,"<name>, perhaps it is time to give you a real test.  Are you ready?At the bottom of Blackrock Depths is a passage to the Molten Core.  This is a stronghold of our enemy, held by the most powerful servants of fire on this world.Go to the Molten Core, <name>.  Show me you have the strength and the will to defeat what you find there.And if you have allies among your people, then rally them.  Nothing short of an army can hope to enter the Molten Core and live."
6823,"If you truly wish an allegiance with us, then I invite you to wage war on our foes, the servants of air and earth and fire.  Each defeat you heap upon them will weaken their foothold here, and further prove your adherence to our cause.The campaign will be long, but if you persevere then your glory and honor will be great."
6824,"<name>, your service is of great value to us, so we are reluctant to send you on this last mission for we do not want to lose such a useful agent.But its success would further our war efforts tremendously and... it was deemed worth risking you.We want these captains in the Molten Core destroyed: Lucifron, Sulfuron, Gehennas and Shazzrah.  Kill them and bring me their hands!This task will take every resource you possess, <name>, but if can do it then the Firelords will be dealt a terrible blow."
6844,"There's plenty to do here still, but I think taking this back to the Circle for analysis is key.  Trust me - the work will still be here once this is all said and done.  If it's a journal inside this sticky chitin, then the Circle would finally have a window into the past!Take this to the Circle's archivist in Nighthaven.  His name is Umber, and the man's brilliant.  Touched, sure, but brilliant nonetheless!  Umber's salvaged tomes in far worse shape than this.  If it can be saved, he can do it."
6845,"Anyway, you should check back with me relatively soon... that is if you want to know what was in here.  As soon as I find out what it is, and if it's indeed a book, I'd be happy to share that information with you.In the meantime, I'd check in with the den mother of this little bear camp, Rabine.  No doubt he'll want to know what crazy antics you've been up to.  Never leave the den mother waiting, <name>... that is, unless you want to be doused in honey.It's happened, trust me."
6847,"Your war in the heart of Alterac means nothing to the Syndicate, <class>. We will do as we have always done: Wait until a clear victor rises from the ashes and rubble of this madness and then strike.That, however, is not why we are here now. The All Seeing Eye has been lost - taken by the Winterax trolls of the region.Recover the Eye and our services shall be yours - for whatever time remains for your side.Return to me once you acquire the eye so that I may examine you.<Master Ryson grins.>"

6921,"The Twilight's Hammer has moved into the Moonshrine Ruins of Blackfathom Deeps.  Their presence can only serve to coerce the elements into working against us.  If left unchecked, this region will be theirs for good.<name>, go into Blackfathom and find the ruin's fathom stone; it should be somewhere close in the water.  In it is a fathom core - a device that when properly read it will relate a history of all elemental activity.  If I have it, I and the Earthen Ring can maybe do something to stop them!"
6922,"The defeated water elemental has left behind a strange water globe.  You surmise that the object somehow fed the beast energy.  Inside the globe, a putrid-looking form of water sloshes about.  The globe itself seems impervious to any sort of physical force.If anyone can make any sense of this item, it would be Je'neu Sancrea of the Earthen Ring.  He is located at the Horde's Zoram'gar Outpost in Ashenvale."

6962,"Hey, can you do Greatfather Winter a favor, um, little < boy / girl>?Not to needlessly talk about myself in the third person, but Greatfather Winter has been at this all day and he could use a treat himself.  Some gingerbread cookies and ice cold milk to wash them down with would really hit the spot.  Think you could be a friend to the Greatfather and fetch some for me?"
6963,"Listen... not to shatter the magic of the season here, but Smokywood Pastures could use some assistance - the kind you adventuring types are known to give.We're missing an important shipment of treats that was restocking us for the season, and now we're missing the agent of Smokywood Pastures that we sent out to the field to find it!  Please - the shipment was last reported in the Alterac Mountains, and that's where our man went to look for it.See if both are out there, safe and sound!"
6964,"Gifts, treats, presents... bah, I say!Those goblins pollute the true meaning of this season - the Feast of Winter Veil.  This is a time of renewal; the land slumbers under a blanket of snow brought forth by Greatfather Winter, who is NOT the bumbling fool over there in the red suit!If you're interested in learning what the Feast is all about for yourself, ask Sagorne Creststrider.  I'm sure he'll be surprised that someone cares about history rather than getting presents."
6981,"The shard is a brilliant green, and although solid, what looks like smoke swirls just below the surface. You can't help staring into the depths of the crystal; at the same time, you know there is something very disturbing about it.Maybe you should see if anyone in Ratchet can tell you more about this strange shard."
6982,"The Coldtooth mine is a storage depot for the Horde.  I can't stomach the food they give their troops, and the state of their arms and armor is atrocious!  But... in times like these when supplies are so important, we can use what they have.Enter the Coldtooth mine and bring me back their supplies.  That will help keep the Alliance in fighting shape, and remove much needed equipment from the Horde's warriors.Good luck, <name>.  The mine is to the distant south, deep in Horde territory."

6985,"The Stormpike dwarves are using the Irondeep mine as a storage depot.  I want you to raid that mine and bring me its supplies.  This will curtail the Stormpikes' efforts in Alterac Valley, and will provide us with needed equipment!Be wary, <name>.  The Irondeep mine is deep in Alliance territory, and control of the mine is as shifting as the snows of Alterac."
7001,"The war in the valley has taken its toll on our soldiers. We must revitalize our forces!If we can fill up the stables, the Wolf Riders will once more be able to ride out into the field of battle.Take this muzzle and track down the frostwolves that inhabit the nearby forest. Once you find a wolf, use the muzzle to tame the beast. Bring the tamed beast back to me so that I may place it in the stable.When we have enough wolves stabled, the Wolf Riders will rejoin their patrol on our front lines."
7002,"While some of our soldiers are busy capturing wolves for the stable master, others must provide for the simple necessities that riding requires. I am speaking of riding harnesses, of course.You must strike at the indigenous rams of the region. The very same rams that the Stormpike cavalry uses as mounts!Slay them and return to me with their hides. Once we have gathered enough hides, we will fashion harnesses for the riders. The Frostwolf Wolf Riders will ride once more!"
7003,"I'm going to have to do something about the giants if I stay out here!  They're certainly not good for business, now are they?I've been working on a variant of a gnomish shrinking ray, but I'm using superior GOBLIN technological advances in its construction!  In an effort to avoid inconveniences for myself such as death, I'd like for you to try it out on any of the giants in Feralas.  You should find miniaturization residue on them after you shrink them - bring me back some!"

7082,"The battle lines of Alterac Valley are ever shifting.  Territories swing back and forth as we meet our opponents in deadly combat.  And graveyards, <name>, are where battles rage most fierce.I want you to attack an Alliance held graveyard!  Find a graveyard with an Alliance banner in its midst and pull it from the ground.Do that and your task for me will be complete, but... if you hold the graveyard for a few minutes, then it will be ours and troops will come and relieve you."
7101,"Towers and bunkers are important positions, and we must capture and hold them all!  So to that end, I want you to attack a bunker that is controlled by the enemy.To do that, enter one with an Alliance banner.  You will see another banner inside.  Pull out that banner, and a white Horde banner will appear in its place.  Well done!At that point your task for me will be complete, but if you hold the place long enough, and if the Alliance doesn't take it back, then it will be destroyed!"
7102,"Towers and bunkers are key defensive positions, and so we must hold as many as possible!  I want you to attack a tower or a bunker in Alterac Valley.To do that, enter a tower with a Horde banner atop it.  You will see another enemy banner inside.  Pull out that banner, and a white Alliance banner will appear in its place.  Well done!At that point your mission for me will be complete, but hold the area long enough, and if the Horde doesn't take it back, then it will be destroyed!"
7121,"<name>, our quartermaster charged me to direct new recruits to him.  He needs supplies from caches stored in the mines of Alterac, and he'll probably send you to get them.Follow the road.  You'll find our quartermaster to the west."
7122,"The mines in Alterac Valley hold more than just minerals.  Both the Frostwolf and Stormpike have cached excess supplies in the Irondeep and Coldtooth mines... that's not a bad idea, if we could only maintain control of them!Capture a mine, then return to me.  To capture a mine, enter one that we do not control and kill its leader.  When you do that, the mine will be ours, and we'll send troops to protect it!"
7123,"<name>, the Frostwolf Quartermaster is looking for recruits, for tasks that lead into the mines of Alterac Valley.  Speak with him; he will tell you more.Follow the road west into the bunker, then take the west exit and you'll find our quartermaster."
7124,"As battle rages over the landscape of Alterac Valley, so too does it rage through the Coldtooth and Irondeep mines.  Both are rich sources of minerals and both are used to store supplies; it's no wonder they are so highly valued!Help our war effort, <name>!  Capture one of the mines for the Horde!  To capture a mine, enter one that we do not control and kill its leader.  When that is done, the mine will be ours and we'll send troops to protect it!"
7141,"The Explorers' League believes there are artifacts in Alterac Valley, but the Frostwolf orcs won't let us explore.  We can't allow the Horde to stop our scholarly pursuits!  Defeat the Frostwolf general, Drek'Thar.  With him dead, the orcs will lose their edge.Drek'Thar is in Frostwolf Keep, in the south of Alterac Valley.  Vanquish him, and then return to me."
7142,"The Stormpike dwarves and their allies have invaded Alterac Valley, and we must drive them out!  To win the battle for Alterac, we must defeat their general, Vanndar Stormpike!You will find Vanndar in Dun Baldar, in the north of Alterac Valley.Destroy him, <name>, and then return to me."
7161,"Hail, <class>. It has been a long time since we have had the chance to answer the call of battle. The old feelings are slow to rise but once awakened, the blood does rush. The battle rage returns...All newcomers to the Valley must first complete the rite of battle.Deep within the Wildpaw gnoll cave is a banner of the Frostwolf. Venture forth and recover the banner. Return it to me and I shall grant you the Frostwolf initiate's insignia."
7162,"You've arrived just in time, <class>. These Frostwolf savages just won't give up! We must show them the might of the Stormpike. They must bow to our superiority.Before you make your way to the field of battle, you will want to join the rank of Stormpike.Southwest of Dun Baldar, you will find the Icewing Caverns. Planted deep within the caverns is a Stormpike Banner. Venture forth and recover that banner. Return it to me, and you will have earned a Stormpike initiate's insignia."
7181,"The invading Stormpike are not the only threat in the region, soldier. The war in the Valley is waged on two fronts. The cannibal Winterax trolls also vie for power.They are lead by Korrak the Bloodrager - a cruel and cunning beast.A strike against Korrak could prove to be a crushing blow to the Winterax clan. Slay the beast and be rewarded!"
7201,"There is work to be had for those venturing into the depths, <name>.The Dark Irons have mastered creation of extremely powerful golems.Initial reports from our spies indicate that the dwarves use a unique power source to give their creations incomparable killing power.Just imagine what we could do with our abominations if we could get our hands on this essence of the elements! Turn that city upside down if you must, but do not return until you have found the essence! Payment will be worth the risk."
7202,"The indigenous Winterax trolls of the region are ruthless savages that would love nothing more than to have our bones added to their foul stew.We must show them our might!We have recovered tomes from their caves that detail their leadership hierarchy. The artifacts indicate that their leader, Korrak the Bloodrager, tends to remain hidden until given a reason to make his presence known.Death to Korrak would mean death to Winterax Clan! Slay him and return."
7223,"Battles rage constantly in Alterac Valley, and the supplies we get from Ironforge are not enough to outfit our experienced troops.If you find armor scraps from the battlefield, aid the war effort and bring those scraps to me!"
7224,"When you fight the enemy, gather the scraps of their armor and bring them to me.  I'll use those scraps to make armor for our own troops!"
7241,"The drums of war sound off in a distant land, <class>. The favored clan of your Warchief is under attack from the nefarious Stormpike Guard of Ironforge.By the looks of you, I can discern that you are indeed battle hardy and prepared to take on the cause of the Frostwolf.It is you who must now take the next step in your evolution.North of Tarren Mill, in Alterac,  you will find the entrance to Alterac Valley. It is there that you will find Warmaster Laggrond. Hurry <class>, for the battle is upon us!"
7261,"We are fighting a brutal battle in the valleys of Alterac. The cannibalistic Winterax trolls attack us from one side and the savage Frostwolf Clan from the other. Both must be exterminated in the name of King Magni Bronzebeard! The taking, culling, and turning of that land is a sovereign and territorial imperative to the kingdom of Ironforge.Alas, soldiers do not grow on trees! Report to Lieutenant Haggerdin outside Alterac Valley to begin your tour of duty and honor amongst the Stormpike."
7281,"Tragic... My brother faces me on the field of battle: A commander for the Stormpike.Of the four Stormpike Commanders, he is undoubtedly the most dangerous. Perhaps if he is slain, the Banshee Queen could turn him as she did me - show him the error of his ways...Deep within enemy territory you will find my brother. Slay him and return to me. I trust that you are capable of completing this mission, soldier.And soldier, do not go alone."
7282,"He must be put out of his misery, soldier! He knows not what he does. He has become a mindless servant of the dreaded Banshee Queen.Venture forth, across the Field of Strife, to the depths of Frostwolf territory. Find my brother and destroy him. His torment must come to an end."
7301,"We got them held prisoner, <race>. I'm talking about their Wing Commanders. It was a furious battle in the skies but they finally fell! Unfortunately, our best pilots were shot down in a counterattack against Frostwolf Keep. You gotta find out what happened to them.Search Tower Point West and Frostwolf Keep. These were their last known locations. Search these areas thoroughly."
7302,"Our air support is in shambles, <name>. The Wing Commanders were shot down over enemy territory. You must find out what became of them so that we can attempt a rescue!Guse was last seen flying over the Icewing Bunker. Jeztor's War Rider was spotted near the Stormpike lumber mill. Mulverick... that reckless fool was seen crashing near the Dun'Baldar North Bunker.That's all the information I have. Move out! Search through the areas thoroughly."
7321,"Who says that the undead don't know anything about cooking? Take my secret recipe for Turtle Bisque, for example. I've known folks that would come back from the dead just to enjoy a bowl! Heh, heh...Speaking of which, I haven't been able to make any lately.  I used to head over to Lake Lordamere myself to hunt snapjaws, the nasty things, but I can't pull myself away from my work here.If you bring me some Turtle Meat from the snapjaws and soothing spices, I'll show you how it's done!"
7361,"<Najak snarls.>Before the night elves existed there was troll. It was from troll that the night elves came.Their mutinous attacks against my people will not be tolerated. Staghelm seeks to wipe us out - to leave no trace of those that bore him and his ilk. It will not happen!For every night elf that you slay and decapitate, Najak will grant you favor amongst the Darkspear. Word of your deeds will be spread across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. Go now and serve the Darkspear!"
7362,"The Elder Crone has sent me to this warzone to research the other races. More specifically, I am to collect gnome samples. Magatha is primarily interested in their survivability. Aye, the gnomes - while pitifully weak and miniscule - exude great resilience both in and out of combat.Fortunately for you, I am looking for ruffians to do Magatha's bidding. Return to me with tufts of gnome hair and you shall be known to the tauren as an ally."
7363,"Humans are so utterly detestable.<Commander Philips grimaces.>While it is true that I am a soldier of Frostwolf, I remain a servant of Sylvanas.During my tour of duty, I do extra work on the side for the Dark Apothecaries of the Undercity.I have been tasked with collecting human bone chips that are to be used in curing the human condition.I am authorized to pass that task on to my subordinates.Find them. Kill them. Return their bone chips to me."
7364,"The High Tinkerer himself has sent me to this field of battle to defend my gnomish brothers and sisters. We have received word that the tauren are singling out and slaying gnomes. Worst of all, they are removing tufts of glorious gnome hair from the corpses of the fallen. These atrocities must be stopped. We must reciprocate!I want them de-hoofed, <class>. Bring me their hooves! Show yourself as an ally of the gnomes."
7365,Staghelm has given the order. All trolls on the field of battle must be exterminated. Their preposterous claims of birthing night elves must be met with force and due prejudice.Slay them and return to me with their mojo. To reiterate: I want you to steal their mojo.
7366,"The Archbishop is as kind as he is wise. For a man to look mercifully on such a wretched lot...<Commander Philips shakes his head in disbelief.>Too kind... Just too kind.The Archbishop asks that we take pity on the undead and grant them swift and permanent deaths. For this grand display of mercy, we merely require their black, disease ridden hearts.Bring me the hearts of the Forsaken so that they may be ceremoniously incinerated at the Cathedral of Light. Make haste, <name>!"
7367,"The Frostwolf have their front lines and bases booby trapped, <class>. You have to watch your step when invading enemy territory.If you want to make a solid strike against them, you must destroy their source of anti personnel munitions - I'm talking about their explosives expert. If you kill him, you are safe to disarm the mines. As long as he is kept down, the mines will also stay down.You will probably find him in a tower near the Iceblood Garrison. Good luck!"
7368,"I know all about landmines. I'm the one that lays all the mines on the front lines here, after all.If you want to defuse the Stormpike mine fields, all you have to do is kill their explosives expert. That dwarven coward is no doubt hiding in the first tower on the Field of Strife. Take him out and those landmines won't come back after they've been disarmed.If you do happen to kill him, come back here and let me know. No good deed should go unrewarded."
7381,"While it is true that Korrak has been slain, one question remains: Will he remain dead? Trolls are notorious for their other-worldly tribal magics. I would not be surprised if the fallen leader was raised from the dead to once more rule over his clan.You know what to do should this ever occur.<Warmaster Laggrond makes a cutting motion across his neck with his index finger.>And  this time, I want his skull. Just keep your eyes peeled, soldier.Dismissed!"
7382,"There's something not quite right about all of this... Did anybody think to burn Korrak's corpse? Those trolls will stop at nothing to revive their fallen leader - as blue skinned pagan man-beasts often do.Just keep your eyes out, <name>. Don't be alarmed if Korrak makes a surprise appearance; and if he does, I want him executed - his corpse burned to ashes.For good measure, lop off his head and bring me his skull before you ignite the lifeless mass."
7383,"All was not well with Teldrassil, however. Staghelm's carefully made plans for the new World Tree had borne out as he had hoped, but there was one small problem, a problem to which many of the troubles on Teldrassil may be attributed.However, I will not get into that yet. You must visit the last moonwell, to the northwest in the Oracle Glade. Under the boughs of the Oracle Tree lies the first and most powerful of our wells. Retrieve a phial of its water and return to me."
7385,"You have the option of offering larger quantities of the blood taken from our enemies. I will be glad to accept gallon sized offerings, <name>."
7386,"There are times which you may be entrenched in battle for days or weeks on end. During those longer periods of activity you may end up collecting large clusters of the Frostwolf's storm crystals.The Circle accepts such offerings, <name>."
7401,"By order of Sergeant Yazra Bloodsnarl, all dwarves on the field of battle are to be killed on sight.Should you slay a dwarf in combat, rip out their spine, leaving a spineless heap of stink and rot to serve as a warning to any and all that dare oppose the might of the Frostwolf.Return to Sergeant Yazra Bloodsnarl with proof of your heroics."
7402,"By order of Corporal Noreg Stormpike, all able bodied soldiers of Stormpike are required to slay any opposing orcs that they meet upon the field of battle.Soldiers are required to remove a tusk or tooth from the maw of the enemy and present said tooth as proof of their accomplishment.Wear protective gloves."
7441,"I had let my guard down for only one moment, stranger. In my haste to escape the grip of the fallen Prince, I was robbed. A most foul demon, the imp Pusillin, pilfered my book of incantations and the key to the once great halls of Eldre'Thalas.I no longer hold interest in the key, as I have exchanged my immortality for freedom, but I desperately need my book of incantations.Find the imp, Pusillin, and recover my book.Search the Warpwood Quarter of Dire Maul for Pusillin."
7461,"Have you heard enough? Are you a < man/woman> of action?This madness must come to an end. The age of the immortals has long since passed. Destroy the guardians surrounding the pylons to lower the force field. When this is done, destroy Immol'thar. With the Prince's power greatly reduced, attack and end him. Lay the spirits of this city to rest, adventurer."
7462,"In the library, Athenaeum, you will find an ancient chest hidden beneath the stairway. Take from it that which you desire."
7463,"A <race> mage! How wonderous. I have not seen one of your kind for... oh what is it going on now? 500 years!I have something that will quench your thirst, but first you must do a task for me.<Lydros snickers.>There is an anomaly in Eldre'Thalas. A water elemental has taken residence in the east wing. His presence must be catalogued!Venture to the Warpwood Quarter and extract a portion of the elemental essence of the Hydrospawn. Return it to me and I shall teach you a useful cantrip."
7481,"Several years ago, a lone elven master named Kariel Winthalus fled the devastation of his homeland with several ancient elven artifacts in tow.Our search for this lost master lead us from the ruins of Quel'Thalas, through the Burning Steppes, across the great expanses of the sea, to Feralas.We suspect that the elf sought sanctuary in the halls of Eldre'Thalas (what is now known as Dire Maul).You must find him, adventurer. Whether alive or dead, the knowledge he carried must be recovered!"
7482,"Several years ago, a lone elven master named Kariel Winthalus fled the devastation of his homeland with several ancient elven artifacts in tow.Our search for this lost master lead us from the ruins of Quel'Thalas, through the Burning Steppes, across the great expanses of the sea, to Feralas.We suspect that the elf sought sanctuary in the halls of Eldre'Thalas (what is now known as Dire Maul).You must find him, adventurer. Whether alive or dead, the knowledge he carried must be recovered!"
7483,"Master Winthalus lost the Libram of Rapidity in the east wing. The Libram will allow for a minor haste cantrip to be placed upon your equipment. Parlor tricks, really...Regardless, if you are interested, you will need to present the Libram along with some basic reagents.Hrm... I believe it also requires blood of heroes, a pristine black diamond, and large brilliant shards. I could be wrong!<Lydros shrugs.>"
7484,"This libram almost aroused interest in one of the younger Lorekeeper's familiars. Poor thing, it was only a few weeks old.Those among you who are more magically inclined might find this item interesting.The Libram of Focus was lost in this wing. I can only assume one of the Highborne spirits holds it in their possession.Bring the Libram along with some large brilliant shards, skin of shadow, and a pristine black diamond and I shall conjure the Arcanum."
7485,"He wept like an infant at the loss of this libram. Mind you, I myself have wept over texts - there is no greater loss than that of knowledge and history - but to cry over this nearly useless jumbling of incantations? Preposterous! It left me to believe that the Prince was doing him a favor in flaying the flesh from his bones.Bring the Libram along with a pristine black diamond, large brilliant shards, and a frayed abomination stitching and I shall recreate the Arcanum.Oh, and check the north wing."
7486,"<name>, your services to the Warlords surpassed all we could expect from the denizens of this world.We do not understand your people's notions of gratitude, or rewarding good works, but in this case... perhaps a reward is warranted.Under the surf at the southern base of this island, you will find a coffer.  In it you will find your... reward.Go, <name>.  Claim your reward."
7488,"The mage Lethtendris, a vicious blood elf whose brutality is matched only by her twisted addiction to magic, has fled into Dire Maul.  She has created a device, a web to ensnare the magical energies of that place and we fear that, if left unchecked, she will cause irreparable damage to our world!Stop her, <name>.  Find her and retrieve her web.  She is likely near the satyrs in Warpwood Quarter of Dire Maul.  Bring the web to me so that its power may be released safely back into the wilds..."
7489,"The blood elf Lethtendris has overstepped her bounds.  So eager was she to gather magical power that she defied her brethren and created a device of insidious design, a web meant to siphon the tainted magical energies of Dire Maul.  Even now she gathers those energies and plans to release them against her enemies.Lethtendris must be stopped.  Find her within the Warpwood Quarter of Dire Maul, defeat her and bring her web to me so that it might be returned to more clear-headed blood elves for study."
7490,You have accomplished the impossible. The brood mother of the Black Dragonflight lies dead at your feet. Take her head and present it to your Warchief.
7491,"Overlord Runthak awaits your arrival in the Valley of Strength.<Thrall salutes you.>Do not keep your public waiting, hero."
7492,"Talo Thornhoof, a Tauren elder in Feralas, sends a request for aid.  He offered few details, but he did say that he needs agents for a matter both delicate... and dire.Serve the Horde, <name>.  Go to Camp Mojache in Feralas and speak with Talo."
7494,"<name>!  Your aid is needed in Feralas!An outlaw mage, Lethtendris, has fled to the ancient elven ruins Eldre'thalas, now called Dire Maul.  It is believed she has an item of dangerous magical energy which must be recovered.Latronicus Moonspear requests agents to enter Dire Maul and retrieve the item from Lethtendris.Serve the Alliance!  Seek out Latronicus at the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas."
7495,You have accomplished the impossible. The brood mother of the Black Dragonflight lies dead at your feet. Take her head and present it to the Highlord.
7496,"Seek out Major Mattingly in the Valley of Heroes, <name>. He will be expecting you..."
7498,The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.
7499,The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.
7500,The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.
7501,The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.
7502,The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.
7503,The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.
7504,The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.
7505,The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.
7506,The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.
7507,You have uncovered something of great importance. This book is unlike any that you have seen.It would appear as if someone or something has managed to shatter the seal of Athenaeum. The text within is garbled and barely legible.
7508,"If you wish to take on this task, present Lydros with the dull blade."
7509,"Take the unfired ancient blade to the lair of Onyxia and engage her in battle.Some trickery must be utilized for the heating of the blade. While in combat, she will surely try to incinerate you with her fiery breath. You must plant the unfired ancient blade nearby and hope that the fiery breath heats the blade. If you live beyond this, pick up the now heated ancient blade and finish off the dragon.Plunge the heated ancient blade into her smoldering corpse to fashion the treated ancient blade."
7562,"<name>, your delvings into the dark arts are deep.  Your mastery over otherworldly denizens has grown so strong... perhaps you are ready to bind to you one of the infamous dreadsteeds."
7563,"The dreadsteeds dwell on another world, on the fiery Plains of Xoroth, and to bind one of those famed beasts you must invoke powerful glyphs.  I can scribe the glyphs on a parchment for you, but first I will need a special ink.In distant Winterspring there dwells a race of owl beasts.  Once pure creatures, they were turned mad by the demonic emanations of the Darkwhisper Gorge and now roam the snows in a frenzy.Their blood is what I need to ink your parchment.  Bring it to me."
7564,"My servant, Gorzeeki, is an alchemist of some skill.  He can prepare the ink I will need for your parchment.  I gathered together the blood you acquired; take it to Gorzeeki so that he can begin his work."
7581,You must retrieve bindings for the prison of the Doomguard from lesser demons.The blood of the Wildspawn satyr that occupy Dire Maul should do nicely. The coagulated blood will bond the Hederine shards and power the crystal prison.
7582,"The Hederine demons that occupy the foothills of Mount Hyjal secrete powerful fel poisons, which if left to mature, harden into a dense anti-magic crystal. These crystals have come to be known as Tears of the Hederine.Not even the immense power of a Doomguard could break the walls of a prison constructed from this material.Travel to Darkwhisper Gorge in Winterspring and recover the Tears."
7583,"The prison is ready. Now for the most difficult portion of this task.You must find and capture a Doomguard Commander within the Tainted Scar using this crystal prison.Be warned! A Doomguard is a cunning and lethal adversary and will seek to destroy you as you begin the ritual of imprisonment. It will flail wildly in its attempts to escape imprisonment.It will focus on nothing but you, <name>. Because of this, I must recommend that you take companions capable of keeping you alive!"
7601,"If I am to teach you the secrets of summoning an infernal servant, you must destroy Kroshius and bring me the infernal core from his burning remains. This, however, is not as easy as it sounds. Kroshius has all but burned out completely. You must reignite his corpse and raise him from the rubble. To do this, however, you must gather some components from other demonic entities.My imp, Impsy, shall set you on your way."
7602,"If you're going to reanimate Kroshius, you're going to need Fel fire. I can make Fel fire but it's going to require some components.You need to bring me flawless Fel essences from three distinct regions of the world.The Legashi Satyrs of Azshara will have the first essence type; the Jaedenar legionnaires of Jaedenar the second type and the felguard sentries of the Blasted Lands the third.Bring me back one of each essence type and I will create the Fel fire, allowing you to reanimate Kroshius."
7603,"Kroshius lays in a heap to the northeast, in the Shatter Scar Vale. Take this Fel fire and use it on his remains. The fire should reanimate the fallen infernal.At this point, I fully expect him to kill you and any friends that you may have brought along - and trust me, you will want to bring along some friends.If by some miracle you happen to kill Kroshius, take his infernal core and return it to Niby."
7604,"The undersigned hereby declares that the Sulfuron ingot they are delivering to the Thorium Brotherhood (TB Ltd.) is genuine and not a facsimile thereof. The undersigned also acknowledges that any harm that should come to < him/her> as a result of attempting to build, forge, find, create, sell, or eat Sulfuras, is not the responsibility or fault of TB Ltd.By signing this contract, you are agreeing to all terms listed herein._________________Signature"
7622,"You must do what I could not: Save the peasants that were cut down while fleeing from Stratholme.They will walk towards the light, you must ensure their survival. Should too many fall, our cursed existence shall continue - you will have failed.Every ability, prayer, and spell that you have learned will be tested. May the Light protect you, <name>."
7623,"Mor'zul says that you want to open a portal to Xoroth.  To do that, you'll need Xorothian stardust.  That's not easy to find on Azeroth!There is one being who might have some: Lord Banehollow in Jaedenar, the seat of the Shadow Council!  Speak with him and he might part with the stardust.But if you're going to Jaedenar, then you'll need to cloak yourself in the Shadow Council's own flavor of evil.  That will require some of my shadowy potions, and that will cost you..."
7624,"You wish to enter my good graces?  Then kill for me.My servant, Ulathek, is pathetic how he grovels before me, all the while plotting with Lord Hel'nurath on Xoroth.  Hel'nurath plans to usurp my power here, and Ulathek is his spy...Prove that you serve me and not my rivals.  Confront Ulathek in his quarters, in the Shadow Hold to the west.  Tell him that I know his secret and watch as fear grips him.  Then, bring me the traitor's heart!"
7625,"So you come to me seeking Xorothian stardust?  You wish to open a portal to Xoroth, the domain of Hel'nurath my rival?  Perhaps you plan to steal from him one of his precious dreadsteeds?Very well.  My servant Ur'dan has a supply of Xorothian stardust.  You may obtain it from him... if you can pay the price."
7626,"A Bell of Dethmoora, named after the late warlock Dethmoora Darkeyes, is one of the three tools needed to create a Circle of Greater Summoning.  When properly atuned with the Wheel and the Candle, these items conduct vast stores of arcane power.My servant Gorzeeki can construct such a bell, but to do so he will need a large supply of elixirs of shadow power.  Procure the elixirs from an alchemist and bring them to Gorzeeki."
7627,"A Wheel of the Black March contains and directs the violent energies required for the Circle of Greater Summoning.  For Gozeeki to construct a wheel, he will need both large brilliant shards from an enchanter, and dark iron ore from a master miner.Acquire these and bring them to my servant."
7628,"A Doomsday Candle stores fire and directs it at those who would disrupt your ritual.  When creating your Circle of Greater Summoning, if your candle is lit then any wayward demons will be burned by its flames!Containing that fire is not easy, and requires the essence within the scales of a black dragon.  Acquire those scales from a skinner and bring them to Gorzeeki Wildeyes."
7629,"There is one more process required for Mor'zul's parchment; I need paper infused with Xorothian stardust.  And... I'm afraid I can't do that here.  I don't have the equipment!There is an alchemy lab, however, with everything needed.  It's in the Scholomance, on the isle of Caer Darrow in the Plaguelands.I can't make the trip, but here - take this jar.  There's an imp inside who is quite clever.  Let him out at the alchemy lab and he'll infuse the parchment."
7630,"Now that the Bell, Wheel and Candle are made, I should make a black lodestone.  During your ritual, you'll need that lodestone to maintain the other ritual objects if they should fail.To make the lodestone, I require arcanite.  Do you have any?  If not, then... you'll have to get the arcanite from an alchemist.Return to me when you have the arcanite, and then I'll make the black lodestone."
7631,"All the preparations are made.  Now, you must perform the ritual to create a Circle of Greater Summoning, then use the parchment infused with Xorothian stardust... to open a portal to Xoroth.I have written the instructions for the ritual onto a scroll.  Study it closely, for you must perform each step exactly if you wish to succeed.Fortune to you, <name>.  And may the souls of your enemies swiftly find their way into your shard pouch."
7632,"The epidermis of the leaf glows a bright green. The surface is extremely rugose, exposing several veins and wrinkles.If you had to take a guess, you would say this leaf came from something ancient and powerful.Maybe you should find the original owner of this leaf?"
7634,"Greetings, <class>. I am Hastat, Ancient of Lore. I hold knowledge lost eons ago.With the proper binding, one of my leaves can serve as a quiver the likes of which has not been seen in 10,000 years. A quiver that when accompanied by a bow of Ancients, could grant untold powers.Return here with sinew from an adult blue dragon and this quiver shall be yours."
7635,"Vartrus may offer you the stave to create a bow of Ancients but only I can enchant the string required to complete the bow.It is a simple task, puny one. Slay a mature black dragon and remove the sinew from its bones. Return that sinew to me and I shall enchant the material into an almost indestructible bow string."
7636,"Agents of the Burning Legion are still active in our world, <class>. These agents corrupt all that they touch. Nature wilts and weeps in their presence.You must track down these demonic corrupters and destroy them, <name>. Be warned, you must engage them by yourself or they will flee. As long as you are alone, they will try and destroy you. You must strike at them, turning their arrogance into misery.I grant you a piece of my bark, the inscriptions shall lead you to your targets. Retrieve their heads."
7637,"In order to prepare yourself for this task, you must first show due sacrifice and judgment... with an emphasis on sacrifice.You must acquire High Priest Rohan's exorcism censer for your task.  Even though its use will be for good and just reasons, due compensation must be given for it.Proceed to Ironforge and speak with the High Priest.  By bringing ample coin with you to help offset the loss of his censer, it will show your due sacrifice.Go now <name>, time is of the essence."
7638,"The time has come, <name>, for you to learn about what it will take for you to acquire something you have no doubt waited on for some time... your charger.Speak with Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker here in Stormwind's Cathedral District.  It is he who will guide you not only though the legerdemain of a Paladin's most trusted mount, but the tasks before you to acquire one of your own.I wish you the best in this trial.  For the Light, noble < brother / sister>!"
7639,"With my blessings, take the censer.  I myself have used it in several exorcisms, and it should serve you well for the arduous tasks that lie ahead.Return now to Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in Stormwind, <name>.  Your quest continues with him."
7640,"I have added a pinch of dirt from the tainted ground of Terrordale in the Eastern Plaguelands to the censer.  You will now use this censer to find areas there that show signs of spiritual turmoil and disturbance.  Look for green auras that permeate the ground as the physical world buckles under the torment of the spirit realm and use the censer to drive out the evil spirits.When you have passed sufficient judgment on the spirits there, you will be ready to proceed."
7641,"A paladin's charger is nothing more than a pack animal without proper barding for it.  The barding used by your charger not only needs to be of the finest materials possible, but because of the circumstances involved it must also be sufficiently attuned to the spirit realm.First things first, <name> - let's get your barding made.  In Stormwind's Dwarven District is one of the finest craftsmen living today, Grimand Elmore.  His work will not be cheap, but his quality is what we seek.  Speak with him."
7642,"You'll need four things for the barding - runecloth for the lining, arcanite bars for the plating, Arthas' Tears for the spiritual attunement, and Stratholme holy water for the spiritual imbuement.  Actually, you need five things... gold for my fee.  That fee includes all labor as well as a handcrafted saddle and stirrups.Once you've got all that, I'll be able to finish your barding.  Until then, there are some things I can get started on for you while you assemble your collection of goods."
7643,"Your barding needs a special form of blessing, one from an appropriate spirit.  In Dire Maul is such a spirit, the Ancient Equine Spirit.  It is currently held by a corrupt treant, Tendris Warpwood.  Pass judgment upon this foul beast, <name>.Know this - freedom alone is not enough.  You must soothe the spirit before receiving its blessing.  For that, special horse feed is needed.  Travel to Southshore first and speak with Merideth Carlson on this... and prepare for more sacrifice."
7644,"As the barding rests on the back of the Ancient Equine Spirit, it glows ever so slightly.  The air is thick with power for a brief moment, and then the barding disappears from the back of the horse and is now secure in your backpack.It would seem that the barding has been blessed.  As per Lord Shadowbreaker's instructions, you should now return with it to him in Stormwind."
7645,"The Silver Hand thought me MAD when I told them that I could make a special horse feed that could nourish spiritual horses.  EVERYONE thought I was mad!  Well, now it's payback time!I'll make what you need, PALADIN... so-called CHAMPION... but it will cost you.  I need special biscuits - Enriched Manna Biscuits sold only by the Argent Dawn - for this blend.  I also demand, yes DEMAND gold as compensation for the misery I have endured!Show me the sacrifice you tout so much, PALADIN."
7646,"We now must assemble a Divination Scryer - this will begin the trial that will allow you to redeem the fallen charger.  Your scryer, actually, is almost done.  The exorcism censer used in Terrordale is the catalyst for it, and I will fashion a suitable housing for the device.The last components needed, though, are two diamonds.  They must be as juxtaposed in brilliance as they are in purpose - an Azerothian and a Pristine Black.  These two will be the beacon by which the scryer will pierce the shadows!"
7647,"Take this satchel - in it are the items you will need for your task.Use the divination scryer in the heart of the Great Ossuary's basement to bring forth accursed spirits that must be judged.  Use your judgments wisely during this trial - they will prove more potent than you realize.  After the spirits, the death knight will appear; defeat him and reclaim the lost soul of the charger.  Only then <name>, will you be able to redeem it and place your barding upon your new steed!Good luck!"
7648,"<Grimand wipes sweat from his brow, beaming with a sense of pride.>There you are, my friend.  This is some of my finest work - as good as the barding I personally made for Lord Shadowbreaker when he went for his own charger.  I thank you for your trust in me to provide for you the best.No doubt Grayson will want to see the work for himself as well.  Take your barding to him, and give him my thanks for his honorable business."

7651,The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.
7667,"<name>, there is a pressing matter I hope you can help with... both materially and spiritually.  Allow me to explain.Within the depths of the Scholomance in Lordaeron is a chamber called the Great Ossuary.  I need to complete a device that would pierce the shadows of this horrid room.  To finish what I have started, I need two diamonds: an Azerothian and a Pristine Black.  These are not trivial items, I know - I just don't have the resources myself.Could you provide me with one of each?"
7701,"By order o' 'is eminence, Overseer Oilfist, the rogue Thorium Brotherhood agent an' newly hired commander o' the Dark Iron Slag Pit crew o' the Cauldron, Overseer Maltorius, is to be killed an' 'is head brung back as proof o' the deed.See Lookout Captan Lolo Longstriker fer the reward on this bounty."
7703,"Now you da king, so maybe you get prized Gordok artifact back from creepy elf who calls himself Prince!  Da king before you failed, just like all da other kings since Tortheldrin - da creepy elf - stole it from old timey Gordok king!Artifact is called da Gauntlet of Gordok Might.  Old timey stories say only da one true king da Gordok can get it back.  Old timey story also say creepy elf is still around here - you find it and it will become mighty gauntlet you wear forever!  Yar, I show you!"
7721,"If I bet against my own better judgment and stay to run an engineering shop along the Forgotten Coast, I will need to deal with these pesky elementals.  Curse the powers of elementalism unchecked, I say!Fortunately for me, and now for you my hopeful agent provocateur, the elementals represent an ideal source of raw power for my Ultra-Shrinker refinement - give them the what-for I say!  When doing this though, be sure to save me the water elemental cores!"
7722,"When that bastard, Maltorius, left our clan, he left with something more valuable than a pristine arcane crystal: Our recipe for fiery flux! I'd bet anything that the recipe was part of the deal in his new promotion amongst the Dark Irons.I want you to get our secret plans back, <name>. I'm sure they're somewhere near Maltorius, deep inside the Slag Pit."
7723,"Unfortunately, I can't dish out the beats like I used to, due to this here fat finger problem. Ye see, the climate out here combined with the lack o' air pressure makes me fingers expand. They're like gigantic Thelsamar Blood Sausages, they are...Ye're gonna have to carry out me orders of business and what have ye.First on me agenda: Poundin' the livin' daylights out o' the heavy war golems o' the Gorge. Get crackin'."
7724,"Wouldn't ye know it, every time ol' Hansel wants to take a moment to relax and reflect upon his life, the powers that be give him another job.Me gots to think, come on! Ye know what I be saying? Come. On.So, these here greater lava spiders are causin' a ruckus o' some sort. Oilfist says they shoot fire out their... erm, yea well, anyway, such things upset the children.I guess we gots to kill 'em. Rather, ye gots to kill 'em."
7725,"I know you've gathered residue for me already... but should you find yourself for want of an encore performance to a fun-time activity, I can always use more residue.While I can't offer nearly as much in the way of compensation again, I'll be more than happy to spread the good word of your service to all my goblin friends with ears.Believe me < sir / madam> when I say that these goblins have quite large ears."
7726,"More work, you say?  Did my heroic mission of collecting bits of goo found inside elemental beings not slake your thirst for adventure?  Perhaps more of the same will vainly try to fill the bottomless well of questing you possess...OK, melodrama aside, I do need more water elemental cores.  I'm trying desperately to set up shop here, so the rewards won't be as great... but I promise you I'll tell everyone in earshot how you've helped me.  Trust me on this - I know people in the Cartel!"
7727,"Bunions, < lad/lass>. Me bunions got bunions. How am I supposed to do any sort of killin' with me feet in such disarray? That's why ye're gonna help.Scrange and Burninate tasked me to kill these things so they can send some expeditionary teams down into the Slag Pit lava pools to do some explorin'. Supposedly some incendosaurs or some such nonsense down there causin' all kinds o' problems. Now move along an' don't come back 'til the incendosaur population be extinct."
7728,"The following items have been stolen:*One Dark Iron Tuyere.*One Lookout's Spyglass.A reward is being offered to individuals who find and return these pilfered items.The Thorium Brotherhood is certain that these items were stolen by unscrupulous and jealous Dark Iron dwarves that inhabit the Searing Gorge.The spyglass in question was an excellent tool for the lookouts and the tuyere was an irreplaceable smithing tool.Should you find the missing items, return them to Scrange."
7729,"Taskmaster Scrange is looking for a few good men and women to help 'cull the competition' in the Searing Gorge.If you are interested in this position, venture out into the Searing Gorge and slaughter every Dark Iron Taskmaster and Dark Iron Slaver that you see.Return to Taskmaster Scrange when your clothes are bloody enough.You'll know when they're bloody enough so don't ask."
7730,"From what scouting we have managed to muster, we believe that the foe south of the gnolls is an insect-like race.  Frankly, it is irrelevant whether or not if they're sentient.  If they are driving the gnolls to frenzy against us, then they are as big of a threat - if not more - than the gnolls.Drive deep into where these Zukk'ash insects dwell; it is known as the Writhing Deep.  Thin their numbers and report back to me what you find, bringing back their carapaces as evidence of your handiwork."
7731,"In surveying the Writhing Deep, one of our scouts reported seeing a giant insect - much larger than the other insects spotted - wandering about the twisted terrain.  Not only is it larger, it also seems to secrete some sort of aura that the other insects don't.  We've given it a name - Stinglasher.The innards of this beast would be invaluable to study as we figure out the best way to deal with this new threat.  Cut out its secretion glands and bring it back to me immediately!"
7732,"You've done doubly well in addressing the threat that the Zukk'ash insects pose to Camp Mojache.  The threat these things pose is far from over, and I'd like to ask you for one last task on behalf of the Horde.This is a document that details all the information we have learned about these Zukk'ash insects.  I want you to deliver it to Zilzibin Drumlore in the Drag of Orgrimmar.  He's an expert on alien creatures like these; I hope he can do something with the lore we've obtained."
7733,"I have a lead on an even BETTER source of hides, if that's even possible to believe!  In the northern parts of Feralas - deep within Rage Scar Hold - are another throng of yetis.  They're much tougher than the ones you dealt with before, so if you're up for a bigger challenge you'd best be on your toes!I would reward you handsomely for a stack of ten of their hides; bring them to me here, and we'll finish our business."

7735,"You have found a pristine yeti hide that is exceptionally thick and sturdy - more so than even the ones you've seen from the yeti in Rage Scar.Considering that Pratt McGrubben at the Feathermoon Stronghold is in the market for yeti hides, this particular one may be of considerable interest to him."
7736,"Let's not waste more of my precious time with jibber jabber, <name>. It's time to focus on replenishing our dwindling fiery flux supply."
7738,"You have found what may very well be a perfect yeti hide.  You easily note that it is exceptionally thick and sturdy - more so than even the ones you've seen from the yeti in Rage Scar.Considering that Jangdor Swiftstrider at Camp Mojache is in the market for yeti hides, this particular one may be of considerable interest to him."
7761,"Imbecile,I hold very little faith in your ability to prevent outsiders from accessing the master's lair. In the very likely event of your death, this orb has its own failsafe built in to prevent outsiders from teleporting directly into Blackwing.Only those with the Mark of Drakkisath branded upon their hand may make use of this orb. Thankfully, Drakkisath is not nearly as incompetent as you, Quartermaster. He guards the brand himself!-Warchief Rend BlackhandP.S. Destroy this letter, idiot."
7781,"The old feeling returns. The welcome pangs of victory reverberate throughout your being. Before you lies the monolithic, battle scarred head of Nefarian. Return it to your Highlord, champion."

7787,"You have defeated the Wind Seeker. Take the dormant blade and force the lying wretch, Demitrian, to use the materials you provided for his betrayal to wake Thunderfury."
7788,"Beyond this tunnel you will find a field of strife and turmoil, young <class>. The Horde continue to decimate our sacred forest, cutting down the evergreen foliage to power their machines of war.Enter Warsong Gulch and defend Silverwing Hold. Push back the invading Horde forces!Do this, and earn a talisman of merit.  Bring me such a talisman, <name>, and I shall reward you."
7789,"The wilds of the Ashenvale forest will succumb to the might of the Horde, <race>. Nothing the Silverwing say or do can stop our sovereign imperative. Kalimdor belongs to the Horde. How dare they attempt to prevent us from harvesting what is rightfully ours!Let the pride swell in your chest as you cut down their weak attempts at slowing our progress. Destroy the Silverwing Sentinels, and earn a Warsong mark of honor.  Return to me with such a mark, <name>, and you will be rewarded."
7810,There must be more to being a master of the arena than this!   Perhaps the Pirate who runs the event at Gurubashi will know!
7815,"Don't let their big eyes fool you, mon! Those saltwater snapjaws be a menace. I can't fish for five minutes without getting a broken line from one of those oversized fish vacuums stealing my bait.Do me and the people of Revantusk Village a service and kill em, mon.Kill the whole lot of em!"
7816,"Yo! There be a turtle out there not like the others. She be the Gammerita, leader of the saltwater snapjaws - a downright dirty thievin' reptile.Mon, she stole my best lure. Snapped it right off my line! Since then, the fish just aren't biting the same.Find Gammerita and get my lure out of her stomach."
7828,"Many brave trolls have been lost to the harsh wilds of the Hinterlands, <race>. The Silvermane wolves are one of the biggest threats to our hunters. They lay in wait, hiding amongst the bushes and landscape, then strike out when the opportunity presents itself.This type of ferocity will not go unchecked!You must think like the Silvermane. Stalk the stalkers! Slay them all!"
7829,"Among the more ornery of the wildlife of the Hinterlands are the savage owlbeasts. Many a good Revantusk warrior has been lost to the ferocious claws and beak of the beasts.Kill every savage owlbeast you see, <race>. Return to me when you can stand no more bloodshed. Your contribution will then be weighed, measured, and judged."
7830,"The filth that calls itself Wildhammer trains gryphon to slay troll. Horrible, I know, but worry not, justice will soon be meted out.For now, I want you to focus on eradicating the elder gryphons of the region. They are known as Skylords.Slay one and return to me with its plume."
7838,Avast Lubber!   Bring me 12 trinkets of the Arena Master and then ye shall be a Grandmaster of the Gurubashi Arena!   Arrrr!
7839,"Vilebranch scum invaded our village and stole my tools! I have backup tools but the set they stole was a gift given to me by a kind hearted gnome that saved my life when I was a young orc.I want those tools back, <name> - they mean the world to me.Markhor reported that the tools were spotted near the Agol'watha and Shaol'watha temples.Those temples are in the northeastern region of the Hinterlands.Recover my tools!"
7840,Lard was at secret special spot having picnic when ugly mean Vilebranch hit Lard wit da big stick. Lard run back to Revantusk but forget Lard lunch. Lard hungry. Maybe you go back to secret special spot and get Lard lunch? Lard scared. Go nort! Island der to da nort is da secret special spot.
7841,"The Wildhammer be striking up deals with our enemies, forgin' new alliances. This time, they be workin' with the high elves, mon.<Otho spits.>We be needin' to send those Wildhammer dwarves a message - a message in the blood of our enemies. Slaughter every Highvale high elf that you come across, leave their bodies as a warnin'.Never mess with trolls!"
7842,"They say the Wildhammer and gryphon are as close to each other as troll and mate. Disgusting, but we be able to use this to our advantage, mon. We send them another message.Kill all the gryphons you see in the Hinterlands, collect their feathers. From this we make the final message."
7843,"<Otho hands you a long, blood drenched spear, wrapped in several gryphon feathers.>You take this, mon. You take this to Aerie Peak, dead center of town by the well. You plant it! Drive it right into the ground! Show those dwarves that troll mean business! Come back when you do this. Hopefully you come back alive."
7844,"Three different tribes of trolls inhabit the Hinterlands, <name>. That is about as far as the similarities between the tribes extends: We are all trolls and we live in the Hinterlands.The Vilebranch - aptly named - are a depraved lot; feeding on other trolls and humanoids.If Zul'jin were here, he would have destroyed the whole lot of them with a flick of his wrist - alas, Zul'jin has not yet returned and we are left to our own devices.It is up to you to destroy the filth of the region!"
7845,"My mate was taken by Vilebranch savages in a bold midnight raid on our village. Our spies have told me that he is still alive and being held prisoner atop Jintha'alor. The Vile Priestess Hexx is said to be preparing him for a sacrifice to the faceless blood God, Hakkar.You must save him, <name>! Our village could not stand a loss this great."

7847,"Return to my mate, Primal Torntusk at Revantusk Village. Tell her that I am coming home! She is sure to reward you."
7848,"Rifts stir, tear, and collapse all around us, <race>. Not two paces from where I stand is a tear leading through the depths of Blackrock Mountain, into the maw of the Firelord.Surprised? Pity... The mortal races cannot comprehend that which they cannot see, touch, or feel.I assure you, the portal is there and access is possible.I've piqued your interest? Attunement is simple. Venture into Blackrock Depths and retrieve a core fragment. Return it to me and I shall attune your essence with the portal."
7849,"Like many in our village, I too have lost a loved one to the wilds. Alas, it was my twin brother Malkhor - taken in the same raid as Torntusk's mate by the Vilebranch.Sadly, he was not fated to live and was given a swift, brutal execution; his remains fed to the oozes and wolves of the Vilebranch.It is too late to save his life but not too late to save his soul. Recover his remains, <name>."
7850,"The Vilebranch fight with supernatural ferocity. This is due to the foul magical weavings of the Vile Priestess Hexx.Throughout Jintha'alor you will find dark vessels of tainted blood. The vessels radiate the foul magic of the faceless blood God, empowering the Vilebranch and also driving them to madness.Steal those vessels and return them to me so that I may remove the taint and ultimately loosen the grip of the blood God."

Heathens then were hunted and killed as vermin.  Those heathens never wavered in their fight against the Blood God.  We honor the price they paid.  They are the freethinkers.Destroy the minions of Hakkar in Zul'Gurub.  Bring me the Paragons of Power I seek.  Success will be greatly rewarded.Go."
8055,"Battle gear gives you power in the tribe.  The freethinkers are honored in this way.  They are zealots.  They imbue their breastplates with powerful mojo.  If their beliefs falter in the face of the enemy, their breastplate will not.You must be revered amongst us to possess such a breastplate.  Go to Zul'Gurub.  Take the Paragons of Power I need.  Take the Paragons most painfully from the fools inside.  Bring them to me.  Prove your worth as a freethinker once and for all."
8056,"The augurs of our tribe are revered for their gifts of the divine sight, ya mon.  They ain't a witch doctor; they spend their time castin' bones or readin' the leaves for insight - not hexin' people.  As a shaman, you already know somethin' about the power of augury; we Zandalar prize the insight they give to the tribe.Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us.  Do this for us, and I'll give ya some bracers that our augurs prize above all others!"
8057,"A haruspex is a key member of our tribe; you'll be wise to listen to their portents.  By communion with animals and givin' them up to the spirits when needed, they give us divine guidance.  In times past, the haruspex's insight and wisdom gave us an edge in the wars against the splintered tribes of the Gurubashi.Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us.  Do this, and I'll give ya bracers that any haruspex of the Zandalar would want."
8058,Vengeance is power.  The Zandalar vindicator is such power.  The tribe has many enemies.  The vindicator exacts retribution on them.  No crime against us is unpunished.  The vindicator delivers this punishment.  Our enemies fear our vengeance.  They should.  They forever will.Become one of our vindicators.  Seek the Paragons of Power inside Zul'Gurub.  Slay the minions of Hakkar and claim vengeance in the tribe's name.  You will be rewarded.
8059,"Warlocks tread dangerous ground in dealing with demons, but our demoniacs take this one step further.  Through an ancient and arcane ritual, they allow a demon to enter their being.  Rather than let it possess them though, they enslave the demon from the inside, absorbing the power of the beast for their own command.  It is a feat few are ever able to master.For you to learn of the power of the demoniac, I must have Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub.  Go there and retrieve that which we seek."
8060,"Mages in our tribe are known as illusionists.  They employ powerful mojo in their incantations, often befuddling and confusing the tribe's enemies!<Al'tabim laughs wickedly.>It is quite the sight to see a powerful illusionist at work, bringing our enemies to their knees from their own madness!For you to know the way of our illusionists, go to Zul'Gurub and bring back to me selected Paragons of Power.  For this, I will give you arm wraps our illusionists use to weave their spells."
8061,"We Zandalar invest power in those who speak with the authority of divinity.  Our priests are more than just healers - they are our confessors.  Evil comes both from outside threats - such as Hakkar - and from within the tribe.  Our confessors act as the judges amongst us, preserving us from the same evil that devoured the Gurubashi from inside itself.Go to Zul'Gurub and bring back the Paragons of Power from the Gurubashi.  Learn what it means to be the confessor, and preserve us from evil."
8062,"In the dark times after the fall of the Gurubashi Empire, Zandalar predators used their prowess to provide sustenance for the tribe.  Hunters claim to be much like our tribe's predators - to seek the hunt is to embody the essence of the predator, yes.  Your hunt in Zul'Gurub, however, will show us how you truly rate amongst our finest predators.Bring to me a sampling of the Paragons of Power from within Zul'Gurub.  Do so, and you'll take first steps in becoming the penultimate predator."
8063,"The madcaps of Zandalar are similar to rogues, but above all else they embrace madness... chaos... the unpredictability of existence.  A terror to behold on the battlefield, they sowed the seeds of confusion and mayhem amongst our enemies in the savage times after the tribes splintered.  We would not be here today without them.Bring to me the Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub that I seek, and I will grant you the first of the madcap's prized armors.  Embrace the madness!"
8064,"We Zandalar know not of druidic ways; nature is to be shaped by our need, not the other way around.  Still, a haruspex is the one of us most in tune with nature, and rightly so.  To give up the ghost of a beastie is to know what it is to be one of them.  That is the real power of nature.Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub, proving yourself to us.  Do this, and I'll give ya a powerful item - a belt used by many of the Zandalar's haruspices.Strong mojo, ya mon!"
8065,"The ultimate symbol of a haruspex's power is what they wear, <name>.  Of these, the tunic symbolizes the connection between themselves and the divine wisdom they seek.  It often weaves parts of the beasties they sacrifice into the tunic; this reminds them of the connection they have to their gifts.Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us.  Do this, and a tunic seeping with the true power of a haruspex is yours."
8066,"A predator knows how to stalk their prey, but a successful one knows how to strike at it once they have closed ranks.  You must master both to have any chance of success in Zul'Gurub... and any chance of being like the Zandalar predators.Bring me choice parts of the Paragons of Power from within Zul'Gurub.  My reward will be the power that the trinkets yield, while yours will be the Zandalar predator's belt - equipment well worth the trade."
8067,"We Zandalar prize what we wear as a symbol of accomplishment.  You don't need to be able to see what one wears to be able to sense what emanates from it - power transcends sight.  The garments of the Zandalar predator are like this, and most cherished by them is the mantle they wear.  It helps to obfuscate them from view... and to make their presence known when they wish it.The Paragons of Power await your retrieval in Zul'Gurub.  Bring me what I seek, and the predator's mantle shall be yours."
8068,"Magic is a raw, primal force to be shaped by those strong enough to do it.  Mojo is our extension of this power; one such potent manipulation of it is in the form of illusion.  How can one truly hope to win against a foe that is not even really there?  We Zandalar know the power of this, and as such illusionists hold a honored place within the tribe.Take the needed Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub - for this, honor from the tribe and a powerful mantle used by our best illusionists will be yours!"
8069,"The tribe acknowledges station and power through what we wear.  Our vestments are made from the finest of materials, and interwoven with the mojo we use to make us powerful.  Illusionists are no exception; their robes are said to embody the essence of illusion in their look.  Legend states that their ancient robes never looked the same twice.I will give you an illusionist's robe, <name>... but earn your place of reverence among the tribe first!  Bring me the Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub!"
8070,"Shortly after the fall of the Gurubashi, we Zandalar almost succumbed to a final defeat from evil within our own tribe.  It was then that the confessors amongst us arose, preserving the tribe by banishing out those who would destroy their own kind.  They not only keep us in tune with the spirits, but they also preserve the flesh.Go forth into Zul'Gurub and witness first hand the depravity of Hakkar and the Gurubashi.  Wrest the Paragons of Power that we seek from them; success will be rewarded!"
8071,"The confessors of the Zandalar all wear a distinctive mantle, marking them as the preservers of the tribe.  These mantles are woven with powerful mojo that aids them in judging those who would threaten our tribe.  As a priest, you too must spend your time judging those worthy and not; such a mantle would definitely be a blessing to you.In exchange for fighting Hakkar's minions in Zul'Gurub and bringing me the Paragons of Power I seek, I will give you a mantle worthy of our finest confessors."
8072,"One of Zandalar's legendary madcaps was Khar'vaxal the Cracked.  Legend states that when facing the enemies of the tribe for the first time, Kar'xavan used his mantle specifically woven with ""the weave of madness"".  His form was shrouded not only by the mantle, but also with the blinding speed of his twin daggers.  Madcaps today cherish their mantle as a sign of their place in the tribe.Bring to me the Paragons of Power I seek, and such a mantle will be yours to weave madness unto your own enemies."
8073,"My eyes failed me long ago, but I do not miss them.  Even in a tribe such as ours - where one's vestments convey station and purpose - the most potent of garb exudes power that simple eyes cannot see.  The prized tunic of the Zandalar madcap is no exception, exuding the raw power of chaos and madness that they are able to channel.The Paragons of Power I need lie in Zul'Gurub; bring me what I seek, and I will reward you with your own legendary tunic... one befitting a weaver of madness."
8074,"Augurs know the mojo of the elements, mon.  They use it as a means to guide the tribe to glory.  In the dark days after the Gurubashi Empire ripped itself up, our augurs led us to our safe haven in the South Seas.  They've also led us back here to the Vale, right back to the heart of evil brewin' in Zul'Gurub.Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us.  Do it and I'll give ya a belt that our augurs use - one with powerful mojo inside it!"
8075,"The augurs of the Zandalar all wear a distinctive chest piece called a hauberk.  It's fitted with the finest of silks and cloths, interwoven with strong chain.  It's a symbol of not only their divinity, but also of their authority, mon.  It's never wise to cross one whose life is devoted to speakin' with the spirits...Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us.  Do it and I'll give ya one of the finest hauberks our augurs would ever hope to wear!"
8076,"The demoniac seeks to embody power outright, not just possess it.  More than one of our demoniacs has lost a fight with a demon; with our enemies threatening us - especially in Zul'Gurub - the power that a demoniac is able to unleash on our foes is worth the sacrifice.  Our survival depends on crushing those who would destroy us; the fall of the Gurubashi Empire taught us this.Travel to Zul'Gurub and gain the Paragons of Power we need.  Do this, and a valuable demoniac item shall be yours."
8077,"The ultimate symbol of power amongst the tribe is the garb we wear in battle.  A demoniac's robes have fused fine runecloth and devastatingly powerful mojo into a single fabric.  The visage of the robe is said to instill fear into the minds of all who see it... especially the demons that the demoniac will eventually dominate.From Zul'Gurub, you must bring me a very specific set of the Paragons of Power.  It will be difficult... but your success will assure you of acquiring a robe for yourself."
8078,The ultimate vengeance waits within Zul'Gurub.  Hakkar must not rise again.  Hakkar destroyed the Gurubashi Empire from within.  No sacrifice was enough.  The trolls are a shadow of former glories.  I know this is because of Hakkar.Become the vindicator you were meant to be.  Wreak havoc on the minions of evil.  Zul'Gurub must taste Zandalar vengeance.  Bring me proof in the Paragons of Power.  You will receive the vindicator's belt.  You will receive real power.Go.
8079,"The vindicator's symbol of power is the breastplate.  It is forged with powerful mojo.  It is trusted only to those we revere.  It is the Zandalar symbol of vengeance.To become a vindicator is to become vengeance.  Take the Paragons of Power we need from Zul'Gurub.  Bring them to us.  We will take the mojo stolen from us.  We will make the minions of Hakkar pay.  We will reward you with the vindicator's breastplate.Go.  Be our vengeance, <name>."

They are the currency used by the various denizens of Zul'Gurub, and each is imbued with subtle but powerful mojo.There are nine distinct kinds to be found.  Some are sought after by my compatriots for various armors they offer Zandalar heroes.  Should you have any extra, I will trade you one of our Honor Tokens for a set of three.

He wishes to remove the enchantment from this bag.Unfortunately, some of my books on the subject of dispelling were taken recently, only to be destroyed by savages.  The remains of my books are still valuable to me.If you can bring me enough of the encoded fragments, I can piece them back together.  Your best chance is to kill the beasts of Azshara, since they have a tendency to pick up just about anything."
8236,"It will take some time to decipher the fragments and remove the enchantment.  When I am complete, I'll deliver the bag to Lord Ravenholdt personally.There is still the matter of the key, said to be held by a green drake known as Morphaz.  The drake has made its home deep in the Temple of Atal'Hakkar, the entrance to which lies in the Swamp of Sorrows.Gather your friends and venture to his lair.  Lord Ravenholdt will await your return with the key."
8238,"I seek the Paragons of Power known as the Coins of the Tribes.  They are the currency used by the various denizens of Zul'Gurub, and each is imbued with subtle but powerful mojo.There are nine distinct kinds to be found.  Some are sought after by my compatriots for various armors they offer Zandalar heroes.  Should you have any extra, I will trade you one of our Honor Tokens for a set of three.  You may use the Tokens with Rin'wosho the Trader; he offers our heroes special items for them."

8240,"The destruction of the various Hakkari Bijous is of grave importance to us, so much so that we welcome outsiders of the tribe to do so for themselves!Take any one of the bijous that you find in Zul'Gurub to the Altar of Zanza and destroy it.  For this one time alone, I will give you an additional Honor Token from our tribe; this is above and beyond what you would normally receive.Witness for yourself the blessings of Zanza!"
8241,"Let's not waste more of my precious time with jibber jabber, <race>. It's time to focus on replenishing our dwindling fiery flux supply.What I'm gonna need from you is the following:*Incendosaur scales.*Iron bars.*Coal.I'll take all that you can offer!And you'll do it fast if you wanna get in good with the Brotherhood."

8250,Archmage Xylem has been asking around lately... for someone of your experience.
8251,"The blood elves in Azshara have developed a method for pulverizing the magical items they acquire.  This glittering dust they produce differs from the components normally acquired by a disenchantment spell.When I sent my apprentice to trade for the dust, he was killed without hesitation.  For that, they must pay.The time for talk is over, <name>.  Find the blood elves along the cliffs of Azshara and use more ""persuasive"" methods to acquire their glittering dust."
8252,"Take a look around you.  The ruins and beaches are overrun with spitelash.  Recently, the wretched creatures have learned to recognize the rare components indigenous to Azshara.Specifically, I speak of enchanted coral -- they are drawn to it by reasons unknown to me.  Now there is little coral left in the bay, and it is vital to my research.  I need you to separate some enchanted coral from the spitelash sirens and bring it to me."
8253,"There is a green drake deep in the sunken temple of Atal'Hakkar by the name of Morphaz.Years ago, he overwhelmed me in a bold ambush and consumed my apprentice whole.  While the loss of an apprentice is not unknown to me, this particular one carried an arcane shard of unsurpassed size and quality.You must gather powerful allies and delve into the temple.  Destroy Morphaz and recover the arcane shard from his ageless stomach."
8254,It is the way of the divine to help those in need.  The how is insignificant -- only the why matters.
8255,"The mosshoof coursers of Azshara are magnificent animals who once lived in Felwood.  They naturally resist disease and poison, and were unaffected by the corruption there.  In their ancestral wisdom, they simply chose to leave that sickened place.It saddens my heart, but I must ask you to hunt these mighty beasts for me.  Gather four courser glands as the first ingredient for a restorative salve -- a salve we will use to heal Felwood."
8256,"For this restorative salve, you must use a simple formula: one part poison, two parts cure.  You have acquired one cure, now you must gather the poison.Powerful undead, such as the lingering highborne who wander the Ruins of Eldarath, are sometimes so infused with evil that it coalesces into a sickly greenish goo.  To the living, this substance is known as ichor of undeath.Due to the potency of this vile element, I require only a single ichor."
8257,"Now the last part, the second cure.The green drake Morphaz is known to be immune to all forms of poison and disease -- many druids died to bring us this information.  There is no doubt his blood is potent for our needs.A courier from the Cenarion Circle will take the parts you have already collected while you gather the last.  Summon your allies and seek out the drake's lair in the sunken temple of Atal'Hakkar.  Bring his blood to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood."
8258,"Death Knight Darkreaver lords over the Great Ossuary in the Scholomance.  He threatens to twist the spirit realm to do his own bidding, and he must be stopped!  This is where the scryer you helped make comes into play.Use the divination scryer in the heart of the Great Ossuary's basement to call forth Darkreaver's spirit minions.  Defeat the spirits and the death knight himself will appear.  <name>, bring me his head!  Only his demise will reverse the damage done to the spirit realm!"
8266,"I understand that it can be difficult at times to come out on top in Warsong Gulch. Still, your effort on our behalf - even when victory is not achieved - is important.Should you complete one of the trials inside Warsong Gulch and not achieve victory, you will still receive a Ribbons of Sacrifice.

8275,"Attention, heroes of the Alliance!  The silithid menace has been left unchecked for too long.  Unfettered by any real opposition, they've been preparing all this time for a large-scale expansion.Cenarion Circle forces are gathering in Silithus to take the fight to these wretched creatures and all able-bodied adventurers are hereby called to join us!Don't wait until it's too late!  Aid us in the defense of Azeroth! Report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold for specific instructions!"
8276,"Attention, champions of the Horde!  There's a threat we've left unchallenged for too long.  Tremors in the earth near silithid hives all around Azeroth have alerted us to large movements in their numbers as they prepare for expansion.Cenarion Circle forces are gathering in Silithus to take the fight to the silithid before it's too late!  No more shall they defile our lands!All able-bodied combatants are to report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold!  The silithid shall be vanquished!"
8277,"Beetix Ficklespragg at your service!  My cousin Noggle makes a living gathering rare herbs for Cenarion Hold alchemists.  Or used to, anyway.  He came back from his last trip with a strong poison running though his veins.I've managed to slow down the venom, but to fully neutralize it I need poison samples from whatever stung him.Noggle arrived from the north, so I'd bet my shirt stonelash scorpids or sand skitterers did it.  Bring me some stingers and fangs and I'll try to make an antidote for him."
8278,"Blasted!  The antidote didn't work.  Noggle must've been stung by one of the stronger creatures in the far south.I'm going to need you to go there and get me some more samples, <name>.  The good news is that since their poison is stronger I won't require as many.  The bad news is that there are more kinds of poisonous creatures crawling around the southern area so you'll have to draw from more sources."
8279,"The Twilight's Hammer are not kind to those that leave their ranks.  They hunt me to this day like I'm some sort of beast!  Needless to say, an enemy of theirs is a friend of mine!To decipher this Tablet I'll need the book used by their scribes to encode secret messages: the Twilight Lexicon.  It's such an important tool that they keep its three chapters in different locations!  The officers entrusted with the Lexicon are known as Twilight Keepers, look for them at the Twilight's Hammer camps."
8280,"Cenarion Hold is a location of utmost strategic importance.  I'm convinced that while we hold it our victory over the silithid is guaranteed.  Provided our influx supplies can be maintained, that is.Desert worms have proven to be more of a threat to our supply caravans than even the silithid themselves.  Just this morning, a large shipment of morrowgrain was ravaged by a group of dredge strikers.  I need you to thin their numbers to ensure our supplies aren't jeopardized."
8281,"Your performance has been truly exemplary so far, <name>.  Our supply lines are not completely safe yet, however.  In the absence of dredge strikers, their larger southern cousins will surely move in to take their place in the north.You'll have to kill quite a few dredge crushers to keep them at bay, but we cannot leave the safety of our supply lines to chance."
8282,"Where am I?  Where's my bag? *gasp* I must've lost it while fleeing from Deathclasp, the giant scorpid.  In my rush to escape I walked right into a nest of stonelash flayers.The satchel I was carrying had all sorts of rare reagents in it.  Without them, me and Beetix won't be able to make the potions that Cenarion Hold needs.  I'm too weak to get up yet, but I can make it worth your while if you bring back my reagents.I ran into Deathclasp in the southern mountain range, behind Bronzebeard's camp."
8283,"The terrible scorpid, Deathclasp, is believed to have retreated to the southern mountain range in the presence of increased silithid activity.  She presents a great threat to patrols and expeditions in the southern regions.  Individuals participating in her destruction will be remunerated handsomely.  Inquire with Captain Vish Kozus, at the top of the Cenarion Hold Watchtower, regarding a reward."
8284,"A camp of Twilight's Hammer cultists once thrived northwest of here.  If you were to venture there now, you'd find the area swarming with elementals and nothing but scattered pieces of wood and canvas to mark the spot where the camp was.I've recovered a few fragments of a clay tablet from the site, but I have too few of them to piece together anything useful.  See if you can find the remaining tablet fragments so we can shed some light into the Twilight's Hammer presence here in Silithus."
8285,"There are rumors of a Twilight's Hammer member called Ortell having deserted his sect.  Word has it he hid in the mountains south of Southwind Village, where he lives as a hermit.  Perhaps you can enlist his help in deciphering the tablet.Take the restored tablet with you and seek out Ortell."
8286,"The embrace of death had all but overcome my being when he intervened. He breathed only once upon my maimed body and then waited patiently for the sands of time to cleanse my wounds.""Forever you will remain if you must,"" he said, and with those words I was bound as a Watcher.Look now to the desert. The second war is upon us. You must seek out the resting place of the Bronze. Venture to the Caverns of Time and see if the master has returned. I must be sure before I am able to proceed."
8287,"Ok, here we are... a pretty valuable chunk of information, I must say!  I've seen the Cenarion Circle forces arrive at Silithus.  They plan to drive the Twilight's Hammer out, don't they?  This will help.Take this parchment to their leader, Commander Mar'alith.  Soon the Twilight's Hammer will be vanquished and I will be outside their grasp for good!"
8288,"There is no time to waste! A hero must be found! The task I give will require an army to complete but only one may rise from the throng of would be champions to take on the burden and responsibility of an ally of the Brood.Within the lair of the Lord of Blackrock is a most cruel beast. The Broodlord Lashlayer guards the Halls of Strife, blocking the way into Nefarian's inner sanctum. Slay the foul aberration and return his head to me. Do this and you may begin the next step of your journey."
8291,"Beyond this tunnel you will find a field of strife and turmoil, young <class>. The Horde continue to decimate our sacred forest, cutting down the evergreen foliage to power their machines of war.Enter Warsong Gulch and defend Silverwing Hold. Push back the invading Horde forces!Do this, and earn a talisman of merit.  Bring me such a talisman, <name>, and I shall reward you."
8294,"The wilds of the Ashenvale forest will succumb to the might of the Horde, <race>. Nothing the Silverwing say or do can stop our sovereign imperative. Kalimdor belongs to the Horde. How dare they attempt to prevent us from harvesting what is rightfully ours!Let the pride swell in your chest as you cut down their weak attempts at slowing our progress. Destroy the Silverwing Sentinels, and earn a Warsong mark of honor.  Return to me with such a mark, <name>, and you will be rewarded."
8297,"War must be fought with soldiers, any soldier will tell you.  They'll also say that a battle fought with poor gear or on an empty stomach is lost before it starts!That is why Arathi Basin is important.  There are key areas in the basin that hold essential resources.  Metals, weapons, food, lumber - all are needed, and all can be gained there.That is what I want from you, <name>.  Enter Arathi Basin, win the battle by holding more bases than the enemy, and return to me with a crate of resources."

8299,"The League of Arathor is sparing no expense in their move to retake Arathi.  They, and all the races of the Alliance, now stream to this distant region, intent on expanding their hold from Refuge Pointe.  We must stop them, and the best means to stop them is to take their supplies.You can help us, <name>.  Enter Arathi Basin, known for its rich mines, fertile land and skilled craftsman.

8301,"The Brood of Nozdormu are naturally distrusting of the lesser races. While it is true that you have proven to me that you have the potential makings of a hero, the time has come to prove this to my master.Hive'Ashi, Hive'Zora, Hive'Regal: All swarming with activity and all a threat to our existence. Slay silithid at these hives and take from them a fragment of their carapace. When you can carry no more, return to me and I shall strengthen your resolve."
8302,"Choose your deputies wisely, mortal. Each time you return with your task complete, a new deputy you will be allowed to choose."
8303,"It is time, <name>."
8304,"My dear Natalia has gone missing.Truth be told, she had been acting strangely for weeks leading up to her disappearance. I had caught her talking to herself when no one was around on more than one occasion. She was adamant that everything was ok and that she must be allowed to continue her research.She was last seen heading to Bronzebeard's camp to the south.My soldiers are spread too thin, <name>. I need you to go to Bronzebeard's camp and question those dwarves."
8305,"In the southern desert of Silithus, near the sacred barrier, exists a single crystalline tear. This tear serves as a symbol of the great losses beset upon us during the War of the Shifting Sands. Locate this tear and gaze into its depths to gain enlightenment."
8306,"I need you to venture into Hive'Regal and find what became of my dearest Natalia, <name>. This will be no easy task for you. Before you dive headlong into the maw of madness, make sure that you go back and speak with those dwarves. They might be able to give you some tips on dealing with the silithid that inhabit that hive.And <name>, if she truly is as mad as they say... do what you must.<Commander Mar'alith turns away from you.>"
8307,"Adapting to life in the desert has been difficult to say the least.  Not only do I miss the birds and trees of Auberdine but our food selection is severely limited by this arid environment.  I'm trying to learn about desert herbs, but there aren't many.I've seen Twilight's Hammer groups from the camp west of here hunt sandworms for food.  Sandworm meat is so bitter though, I can't imagine how they make it palatable.  Keep your eyes open if you go to their camp and let me know if you learn anything."
8308,"To Whom It May Concern:If you're reading this, I'm either dead or soon to be dead. It's hard to say. Most of the crew is dead anyhow.Found information about a Titan. Great battle between him and an Old God. Yes, a bona fide Old God. Found ancient tunnel leading to Ahn'Qiraj. Taking it.Take this letter to my old camp. Make sure my monkey is getting adequate food, water, and hugs.-Brann Bronzebeard, Explorer ExtremeP.S. Watch out for crazy Old God worshipping night elf."
8309,"After our initial foray into the hives and Mistress Mar'alith's subsequent madness the three hives have been spewing out bugs! The increased activity might be tied into the glyphs covering those strange crystals.We must get a rubbing from crystals in all three hives. If we can get those rubbings, we might be able to make sense of this madness.Take this transcription set  and hit those hives, <name>. Don't come back until you've gotten copies from each hive."
8310,"I think I can formulate an elixir that will allow us to more readily decipher the glyphs and language of the silithid and Qiraji! What do I need? Glad you asked! I need brains! More specifically, a brain from each silithid type that inhabit the hives. Bring me brains and Rutgar's work might not be for naught."
8311,"I want to go trick-or-treating, but I can't because I'm sick.  If you go for me, I'd trade you the candy you get for some I already have!  I think you'd like this candy - it makes you turn into things both funny and scary!Each of the innkeepers in the big cities have candy they give for Hallow's End - talk to them and do the tricks they ask for!  Also, a little gnome named Talvash in Ironforge is handing out candy as well.  When you have all the candy, bring them back to me here!"

8313,"While the recipe for cooking sandworm meat is legible, it contains references to herbs and spices you've never heard of.  Calandrath might have enough knowledge of the plants that grow in the desert to make sense of it."
8314,"We're on the verge of a breakthrough, <name>! The rubbings you recovered have allowed us to recreate the glyphs on this crystalline prism. They are apparently a means for the Qiraji and other unknown entities to communicate various messages to the silithid.Unfortunately, that is all we could get out of the glyphs. We need to find a way to unlock the messages hidden within the crystals.Take the glyphed crystal prism to Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold.  She might be able to help."
8315,"The glyphs illustrate an emissary of the Qiraji meeting with three silithid at the bones of a large dragon. Above the glyphs is what I can only assume to be a code of some sort. This code might very well be the key to summoning the emissary.I will create a copy of the glyph code that you must use in the sand at the Bones of Grakkarond. If I am right, the Overlords will come thinking that new data is ready for transmission. Strike them down and confront the emissary. He holds the key to the crystals..."
8317,"That recipe sure will come in handy.  I'd better get to work so I can have some smoked desert dumplings ready for today.  I could use a hand in making some, I'll make it worth your while."
8318,"Some of the Twilight's Hammer cultists carry around little papers with gibberish written on them.  I want you to bring me a stack of them, <class>.I can't figure out what the gibberish means, but that's not the point!  These papers are how their different groups communicate secretly.  The more texts we take out of circulation, the less they can communicate!"
8320,"The Twilight's Hammer, an insane cult bent on destruction, set up camps in Silithus and perform rituals day and night.  We do not yet know their plans, but we do think they are somehow linked to the pulsing red crystals spread across the desert.Although their mystery may one day be solved, we must first deal with their immediate threat.  Go to their camps to the west and seek out Twilight geolords.  They are the heads of these serpents; that is where we must strike!"
8321,"We have discovered another base of operations for the Twilight's Hammer.  It is called Twilight's Run; it is a cave tucked in the northeast corner of Silithus.  The local leader of the cult, Vyral the Vile, haunts that cave - it is he who you must next defeat.  When you have done this, bring me his signet ring.Fortune to you, <name>.  The horrors of Twilight's Run are formidable indeed."
8322,"The humans of Southshore love their ale, and as such they prize the ale served at the Southshore Inn.  With the chaos of Hallow's End now upon them, we can use it to ruin their latest batch of beverages for weeks - if not months to come!Take these rotten eggs and place them in the main brew keg inside the Southshore Inn.  Your presence alone will cause strife, so be prepared to defend yourself!Once you've given Southshore a taste they'll not soon forget, return to me here at the festival!"
8323,"Now that I have the Twilight Lexicon in my possession, there is a small favor I'd like to ask of you.My former organization has a secret encoded bulletin they circulate on a monthly basis.If they make any progress searching for me or if they call off the search, word will be published on the True Believer.Although this information is obviously valuable to me, the publication contains other useful information that I can share.  Bring me any encoded texts you find on Twilight's Hammer members."
8331,"<name>, although we had hoped the Twilight's Hammer's operations in Silithus were slowing... we were, regrettably, mistaken.  Through continued forays against the cult, we have learned that an even darker power, the Abyssal Council, controls the Hammer through the arcane wind stones dotted amongst the cult's camps.  Your next action, <name>, will be against the Abyssal Council."
8332,"We think it is possible to use a wind stone to ambush a duke of the Abyssal Council.  To do this, however, one must commune through the wind stone, and convince the council you are a middle ranked leader of the Twilight's Hammer."
8341,"Lords of the Abyssal Council can only be summoned through the greater wind stones, and only the top ranking members of the Twilight's Council may speak to them.  But... I have found a way to upgrade your disguise and fool the Abyssal Lords!"
8343,"<name>, Aurel Goldleaf thinks she's found a way to summon and defeat a ruling member of the Abyssal Council!  Such a task will be dangerous, but you have earned great respect amongst the Cenarion Circle.  We know that if anyone can do it, you can."
8348,Huum tells me you've figured out how to summon the Abyssal Dukes!  That's quite an accomplishment.
8349,"Now that you have a medallion and can summon an Abyssal Duke, speak with Bor Wildmane.  He will set you on a task against the Abyssal Council."
8351,"Now that you can disguise yourself as a ruling member of the Twilight Council, I am certain Bor Wildmane will want to speak with you.  Go see him, and prepare yourself for a very difficult mission..."
8352,Huum and I were just talking about you.  He tells me you're just about ready to try your hand at fighting an Abyssal Lord!
8353,"Ah, trick-or-treating for a sick child, are we?  I was going to say, you're a little old to be rummaging about for candies...Well, for my treat - an Ironforge Mint - you will need to... cluck like a chicken!  Yes, chickens love mints... well OK, maybe they don't LOVE them... but I won't give you a mint unless you chicken cluck for me!Well <class>, are you up to the challenge or not?!

The price of this gumdrop is one train noise!Chugga-chugga, <class>!"
8356,"That's an... interesting costume you have on.

Yes, go on now and flex for me, strong < man / woman>!When and only when you flex, I'll give you some tasty Stormwind Nougat.  It's a great Hallow's End treat."
8357,"Even though you're trick-or-treating for a sick child, you still need to perform a trick for the treat!  We can't very well change the tradition, now can we...I believe the cost of a piece of marzipan nowadays is to bust out and DANCE!  That's right, let me see your moves!  Dance for me, and I'll give you some tasty marzipan!"
8358,"A trick-or-treater!  Yeah mon!Well now, even though you're doing something noble and collecting candies for a sick child, I can't let you off the hook that easily.

8361,We've seen the Twilight's Hammer cultists performing rituals to summon powerful elemental nobles.  We don't know if these are the beings the cultists worship or if they act as intermediaries to even more powerful forces.  One thing is for sure: they are receiving orders from these elementals.I want you to find a way to contact an Abyssal Templar and give it a proper beating!  Nothing throws the troops in disarray like taking out the chain of command.  Bring back proof while you're at it.
8365,"You're the help the Cartel sent? I suppose you'll do. Listen carefully <class>. As you know, I am a procurer of fashionable apparel for the elite of Azerothian society.  Kings and Queens, Warchiefs and, well whatever the Horde calls their queens, all wear what I choose is in style.  And they pay through the nose for it, which is the best part.So here's what's going to happen. You head down to Lost Rigger Cove and acquire a lot of pirate hats by whatever means. Do you think you can handle that?"
8366,"Argh! They want the impossible from me!The Steamwheedle Cartel wants me to teach the Southsea pirates a lesson.  The problem is that I can't be in two places at once; I need to stay here to keep the peace.Of late, the pirates have been disregarding the protection money that the cartel regularly forks over. So I'd like to temporarily deputize you to go down there and show them what for.You'll find them at Lost Rigger Cove, which is not too far to the south.  Thanks <name>, I'll owe you one!"
8367,"Serving the Horde in one of the great battles against the Alliance is a source of great honor! The few however, that have served the Horde in ALL of our active battlefronts are our truly great fighters. We shall vanquish our opponents, not by fighting isolated skirmishes, but by waging a well-coordinated war.Go forth and crush the Alliance in Arathi Basin, Alterac Valley and Warsong Gulch! For Honor! For the Horde!"
8368,"The battle in Warsong Gulch against the Silverwing Sentinels is of great importance.  Under the guise of protecting a forest that doesn't belong to them, the Alliance seeks to deny the Horde one of our largest sources for lumber.Do not let this happen, <name>!  Come back to me with proof of serving the Horde in a worthy manner!"
8369,"Listen up, <name>.  No matter what you might have heard about the battle raging in Alterac Valley, one thing remains true: the Stormpike Expedition invaded Frostwolf Territory.  The day we allow the Alliance to invade Horde lands without a forceful response is the day I hang up my axe and live the rest of my life in shame.  Go forth and expel the invaders!"
8370,"Our conflict with the Alliance has escalated to a true war.  No longer are false pretenses to enter into battle used or expected by either side at this point.The battle for the Arathi Basin is one of resources, plain and simple.

8371,"We're not fighting isolated battles against the Horde anymore, < lad/lass>.Victory in one front means denying the Horde resources they'd use against us in a different battle.  By the same token, losing any given battle could give the advantage to our opponent somewhere else around the world.The Alliance is in need of more combatants with this sort of worldly understanding... truly seasoned veterans!  <name>, come back to me after you've served against the Horde at all of our active battlegrounds."
8372,"The Silverwing Sentinels are at war with the Warsong Outriders due to the destruction the Orcs are causing to the forest.

8373,"The thing I hate the most about Hallow's End are the stink bombs the Forsaken use on Southshore.  Who knew that celebrating liberation would have to involve such a smelly mess?During Hallow's End, use this cleaner to remove any nasty stink bombs the Horde may drop here in the village.  It uses the power of pine to fight funky smells.Do your part to keep Southshore clean, and I'll give you some Hallow's End treats I'm sure you'll enjoy.  We have a deal?"
8374,"Winning a war is about more than just outsmarting and outfighting your opponent.  Victory often comes down to simply producing more than your enemy.What we have in Arathi Basin is a sizeable supply of resources for whichever side manages to claim it first.If the Alliance comes out victorious, it'll mean more swords and pikes for our troops.  If the Horde were to win, those swords and pikes would still get made, they'd just be pointed at us!  Now is the time to help the Alliance in Arathi Basin, <name>."
8375,"Make no mistake about it, <name>.  The Horde is quite right when they say Alterac Valley is Frostwolf Territory.You see, the Stormpike Expedition arrived as peaceful visitors to the area in search of ore and relics.  The Frostwolves reacted with the most brutal and uncivilized act of aggression the Alliance has experienced.Let us never forget the brave dwarves that perished in that cowardly unannounced attack.  Go now, <class>, do your part in the battle for Alterac Valley.  For the Alliance!"

8410,Bath'rah the Windwatcher has sent out a summons for a shaman of your wisdom.  He requests you bring a sample of each of the elements to show you are ready.
8411,"Welcome, <class>.  You bring me the elements and then we do the talkin'.The fire, the air, the water, and the earth I be needin' before I trust ya, mon.  I gots to know you be knowledgeable."
8412,"The elemental spirits of this place don't be likin' me any more.You know about the totems more than any, and I be needin' a spirit totem to protect me.  We already got the elements, now we need somethin' more with more nature.  More primal.In the Western Plaguelands you can kill bears for claws and spiders for their eyes.  The carrion birds eat everything, so they might have either one."
8413,"The spirit totem just isn't enough.  We be needin' some voodoo magic to make it work jus' right.The trolls in the sunken temple have feathers strong with voodoo magics.  Go there and kill Gasher, Mijan, Zolo, Hukku, Zul'lor, and Loro.  Then we have magic enough for a real spirit totem."
8414,"Greetings, <class>.  Crusaders like you are a welcome sight in these desolate reaches.Your holy strength is needed to help fight the endless undead here.  We need you to collect a large number of scourgestones and bring them to High Priest Thel'danis.  The high priest can be found guarding Uther's Tomb in Sorrow Hill, not far from here.Only one with an Argent Dawn Commission can hope to find scourgestones, so speak to Officer Pureheart if you haven't already."
8415,"Commander Ashlam Valorfist has sent out a call for a paladin of your purity and valor, <name>.  You can find him at Chillwind Camp in the southern part of the Western Plaguelands.  Seek him and aid in his cause for the Light!"
8416,"The evil has been purged from the stones, <name>.I am aware of Commander Ashlam's plans, and he will require only a single inert stone.  Bring it to him so we may bathe the Scourge in righteous fire."
8417,"In the Blasted Lands, there is a troubled spirit who was once a great hero of the horde.  A warrior's honor does not die with the body, and it would serve you well to speak with him."
8418,"Now we must combine the inert scourgestones and create a weapon to shatter the ranks of undead.  This is no trivial task, <name>.  Only the trolls of the sunken temple carry the kind of rare magic able to turn the evil of something against itself.In the temple, the trolls are known as Gasher, Mijan, Zolo, Hukku, Zul'lor, and Loro.  Do not feel remorse for their corrupt souls... they are not without evil."
8419,"<name>, an imp in Felwood by the name of Impsy has requested your presence.  It is somewhat strange, as he has asked that you bring a piece of felcloth as a sign of good faith.  Considering the power you already wield as a warlock, I can only assume you know the satyrs of Felwood carry this felcloth."
8420,"Maybe this sounds strange coming from an imp, but I'd like a pet of my own.  I really would.  It's just not fair that Niby gets me and I get nothing!In fact, it doesn't even need to be a living pet.  I'd need something to start making it with, like some felcloth.  The satyrs here in Felwood sometimes have felcloth, so you'd just have to kill enough of them until you find some.  That doesn't sound so bad, does it?"
8421,"Now that I have my felcloth, I can really begin making *my* pet.It's going to need some eyes though.  Perhaps you could rip some rotting wood from the irontree folk for me, so I can carve out some lovely eyes.  They're up north in the Irontree Woods.I'll also need some bloodvenom essence to give it that new demon smell.  The tainted oozes carry the essence, and they hang out right here near Niby and me."
8422,"My pet is almost done.  Now I just need something to stuff it with.Only the voodoo feathers from the trolls in the sunken temple will do.  They go by the names Gasher, Mijan, Zolo, Hukku, Zul'lor, and Loro.  Kill them.  Kill them all.This is no trivial task <name>, so I'll make it worth your while by giving you something of Niby's -- he probably doesn't need it anyhow."
8423,"<The Hero looks you over.>You are a <class>, no doubt.  I would ask an honorable task of you, but I must test your strength.It is said that Rexxar would measure the sharpness of his blades by killing a helboar with a single, swift strike.  Now I will measure your strength by killing them."
8424,The continued presence of the shadowsworn in the Blasted Lands bring great pain to me.  Their dark rituals and spells cause agony unlike any I felt while alive.Through you I can deliver my own message of pain.  Go forth and deliver my wrath.
8425,"Your honor has brought some peace to me.  It is only right that I offer you something in return.My weapons and armor were splendid in life, and yet they are of no use to me now.  They would be better served in your possession.Travel to the sunken temple and destroy the troll guardians Gasher, Mijan, Zolo, Hukku, Zul'lor, and Loro.  They carry magic feathers that can reform my physical body long enough to grant you a reward."

8447,"The waters of Lake Elune'ara should dissolve the nightmares engulfing this object. Give me a moment to perform the cleansing, <name>."
8461,"There is a camp of Deadwood furbolgs directly to our southwest.  Corruption permeates the camp, and I wish to put an end to it before they become a problem.The Deadwood tribe is evil, but it is the effects of the fel that pollutes their minds.  Their hostility is not truly an innate quality, yet they cannot be helped.  It saddens me that we must fight our own brethren.Please, <name> - I ask you to do what must be done.  Simply spare me the details; such troublesome images upset me far too much."
8462,"Perhaps you are capable of handling a larger threat that we Timbermaw face.  You certainly have shown yourself capable here...Another of my kind stands guard outside the entrance to Timbermaw Hold, along this road far to the north.  His name is Nafien; while he may appear to be a feral and unsavory beast, fear him not.  He only seeks aid against the malign forces that threaten our home."
8464,"The Timbermaw tend to stay to themselves, <name>. While we do allow safe passage to those that have proven they can be trusted, we try to avoid other furbolg tribes if at all possible.Lately I have noticed that the Winterfall tribe has become increasingly hostile towards us. They seem to be in a state of rage, completely engulfed by their own fear and hatred of anything they do not understand.If you could reduce their numbers this would help us greatly, <name>."
8465,"The threat of corruption comes not only from the Deadwood furbolgs to the south, but also from the east and the Winterfall furbolgs of Winterspring.  If you wish to further aid us, speak with Salfa on the other side of the Hold, by the Winterspring entrance.  Follow the path to the left to reach it.Be warned - if my kind inside considers you hostile or hated, they will attack.  Travel as quick as you can, avoiding conflict.  To kill a Timbermaw - even in self defense - will only alienate you further."
8470,"You have found one of the Deadwood furbolg's ritual totems.  The totem itself is of non-descript construction, but a palpable sense of despair emanates from it.  If there were any object that might best exemplify the corruption that the Deadwood furbolg suffer under, this item would clearly be it.One of the furbolgs inside Timbermaw Hold may have a use for such an item... that is, if you've earned their trust enough for them to speak with you."
8471,"You have found one of the Winterfall furbolg's ritual totems.  The totem itself is of non-descript construction, but it seems to emanate an almost tangible sense of dread and despair.  If many of the Winterfall furbolgs do indeed carry these, it certainly would go a long way in explaining their current condition.One of the furbolgs inside Timbermaw Hold may have a use for such an item... that is, if you've earned their trust enough for them to speak with you."
8481,"<name>, thanks to you we have devised a way to summon forth the root of all evil for the Winterfall tribe - the corrupting demon that dominates them!"
8484,"Your deeds go beyond the tale of a simple hero, <name>.  If you are a representative of your people, then your people are ones we would work to make peace with."
8485,"Your deeds go beyond the tale of a simple hero, <name>.  If you are a representative of your people, then your people are ones we would work to make peace with."
8492,"Hey there, <class>, you look fit enough to contribute to the war effort! We need all of the help that we can get here to put together the materiel needed for the Ahn'Qiraj War and it's your lucky day.I'm collecting copper bars in stacks of twenty. It's for a worthy cause, what do you say? Do you think you could help out the Alliance?"
8493,Back again <class>? Outstanding! We still need more stacks of copper bars if you can procure them for the Ahn'Qiraj war effort.  Will you help us out?
8494,"Well hello there, < Mr. / Ms.> Fancypants, aren't you a sight for sore eyes. In case you hadn't heard while you were out there ""adventuring"", the Alliance has been gearing up for a war in Ahn'Qiraj and is in need of iron bars... a whole mess of 'em. Bring them to me in stacks of twenty. We can count on you, right, <class>?"
8495,"Back so soon? Stop making me re-evaluate my low opinion of you <class>, you're making me feel all gooey inside. So, as you can tell we still don't have enough iron bars for all of the weapons, armor, steam tanks and whatnot that need building for the bug hunt. Think you have it in you to bring back another stack of twenty iron bars in between all of those trips to Zul'Gurub, or wherever it is that you kids hang out these days?"
8496,Our supply of bandages in the battlefield is running dangerously low after the recent casualties we have incurred.  Obtain a batch of first-aid supplies and deliver them to Windcaller Proudhorn in Cenarion Hold.
8497,With the arrival of fresh recruits to Cenarion Hold comes the problem of keeping them alive in the desert.  Dehydration as well as numerous poisonous creatures present a serious threat to inexperienced volunteers.  Gather the supplies necessary for a desert survival kit and bring them to Calandrath in Cenarion Hold.
8498,Our scouts have reported new battle orders being issued by the Twilight's Hammer leaders.  The orders are being distributed by Twilight Prophets under heavy escort.  Intercept the orders and bring them to Commander Mar'alith.
8499,"It is very kind of you to inquire about the needs that the Alliance has. In addition to all of the other collection efforts underway, we are in need of a great quantity of thorium bars, which is the task that I am in charge of. The thorium will be used in the creation of many different things for the war, foremost of which is the construction of a battalion of steam tanks to be airlifted into Silithus as soon as they are completed. Can you aid us in this endeavor, <class>?"
8500,It is so good to see you again <name>. I hope that you've been doing well. It's true that we are still in need of thorium bars. If you have them to spare I am collecting them for the Ahn'Qiraj war effort.
8501,"As the war effort mounts, the silithid presence in the area presents an ever increasing threat to our operations.  You've been selected to partake on an assault on Hive'Ashi where your primary target will consist of the airborne Hive'Ashi stingers.Report back to Commander Mar'alith after your task is completed."
8502,"As the war effort mounts, the silithid presence in the area presents an ever increasing threat to our operations.  You've been selected to partake on an assault on Hive'Ashi where your primary target will consist of Hive'Ashi workers.Report back to Commander Mar'alith after your task is completed."
8503,"So, <class>, did I already tell you about all of the fabulous uses stranglekelp has? I did? Oh well... in any case we need a lot of it, and when I say a lot, I mean A LOT! Do you think that you could help us out? I know that it means going without all of those wonderful things that you can make with it, but it's for a good cause!"
8504,"Well hello again there... what was it? Ah yes, <name>! Come to see if I still need more stranglekelp have you? Well, it's your lucky day, because the answer to that very important question is a very affirmative YES! Think you could gather up twenty more?"
8505,"<class>, the purple lotus is a flower with a plentitude of uses. I am here at the request of the Alliance as an authority on those applications, to preserve the herbs collected and to ensure that their war effort acquires enough purple lotus to sustain whatever function they plan for it.I would like for you to travel out into the world and return to me with some of these flowers. Is that something that you can do?"
8506,"Welcome back <class>. Our collection grows, but even now we have a need for additional purple lotus. If it is still within your power to gather more of the herb, I entreat you to do so and return them to me here."
8507,"Greetings, <name>.  Before I assign you to more involved tasks in the war, you'll need to do your share of field duty.You will find Captain Blackanvil's Ironforge Brigade outside Hive'Zora.Report to him or his lieutenant, Janela Stouthammer and come back to me.  I shall have a more advanced assignment for you ready.Oh and please do us a favor and stay away from the Orgrimmar Legion.  We've been forced to keep the two forces well apart from one another due to mutual animosity."
8509,"I'll keep it simple and to the point, <class>. The Alliance needs to collect a large quantity of Arthas' Tears for the Ahn'Qiraj war effort. Don't ask me what for; I'm just following orders. But I'd like you to gather up as many of the herbs as you can and bring them back to me here. Are you willing to do that?"
8510,"Ok, so it looks like I still need more Arthas' Tears. I would imagine that you will be able to find them in the general location that you gathered them up for me last time. The quicker we get these, the faster we can start up the offensive against the forces at Ahn'Qiraj.You gonna help us out again <class>?"
8511,"We Stoneflayers have a long history of being skinners, <class>. That's why the Alliance has asked my family to help out with the collection of light leather for the Ahn'Qiraj war effort. I'm here to see to it that the leather is tanned correctly for whatever they want to put it to use for. But we need your help.Since I have to be here doing that, I need you to go out and collect the skins, returning them to me here. What do you say, < lad / lass>, will you give it a go?"
8512,Good to see you again <name>. It does appear that we need more light leather for the creation of the various war materiel. If you could bring me a stack of ten that would be just perfect.
8513,"Yes < sir / ma'am>, I have been charged with collecting and tracking all of the medium leather gathered for the war effort. If you have the wherewithal to gather medium leather, from whatever source, then please bring them to me here. I sure would appreciate a hand with this if you can spare the time."
8514,"Yes < sir / ma'am>, looks like we've collected $2063w pieces of medium leather to date. I know it's a lot to ask, but if you're still willing, I could use your help in attempting to put a dent in the rest of my quota."
8515,"Oh boy, this is going to be great! <class>, the Ahn'Qiraj war effort is in full swing, and I've been put in charge of keeping track of all of the thick leather that comes in. We'll make tons of things with it, but first we need to get a ton of it. And I mean that literally! That's where you come in.So, do you think you can go out there and bring me back a nice, fat stack of thick leather? Do yah, do yah?!"
8516,"Yep, the stack's still not high enough. <name>, we still haven't reached our goal of $2071w thick leather. Just think of all the things that we can make with all of that leather! All kinds of armor and weapons. Stuff for inside the steam tanks and rifle scopes! Engineering goggles, and I bet if it ends up that we collect too much we could give the rest to the Horde for their zeppelins!You gonna bring me back some more thick leather?"
8517,"The war at Ahn'Qiraj is going to be long and bloody. It is a very wise thing that the Alliance is doing by enlisting the aid of you, and those like you, to build up the materiel necessary before plunging headlong into conflict.I have been asked to head up the collection of linen bandages for the war, and I am hoping that you are going to assist me in amassing as many as we need. It is no light matter, but at least the linen bandages are the least difficult to create. Are you with us, <class>?"
8518,"Ever am I amazed by the selflessness exhibited when so many would instead turn to selfishness instead. <class>, I am still in need of a number of linen bandages before my assignment here is fulfilled. Will you aid me once more in the collection of those bandages?"
8519,"As you regain your composure and focus your gaze, you notice that something stirs within the crystal. Upon closer inspection, you realize that you are looking into the past... a memory... long forgotten."
8520,"With the Ahn'Qiraj War looming we need to do everything that we can to see to it that our soldiers have everything that they need. We're doing just that right here. For my part I've been placed in charge of seeing to it that we collect enough silk bandages.Do you think you can help me out, <class>?"
8521,"It is very kind of you to offer to help me again <class>. It looks like we've collected $2082w silk bandages, so we'll need more."
8522,"Argue the merits of the war if you will, <class>, but it has already been set in motion. Look around you at your family and friends, and then ask yourself what it is that you can do to see to it that if they are involved, they will have every advantage to survive the conflagration.To that end, I am collecting runecloth bandages here from whatever source. Would you like to make a donation?"
8523,"So it is that we come to discuss pressing matters yet again <class>. Once more I thank you for your previous efforts; it is not everyone who would give so selflessly. But there is still more work to do.<name>, will you once more collect runecloth bandages and return them to me here?"
8524,"Hey there, friend! If I were to say to you, 'Don't you think that soldiers should have food to eat like anyone else?', you would of course reply, 'yes'. I agree with you 110%! I'm glad we're in accord. All I need for you to do is to head out there, fish up a whole bunch of raw rainbow fin albacore, and then cook it all up and bring it back to me right here. Mmm, mmm, I can taste it already."
8525,"What! You again? Well I'll be a monkey's uncle... except that I'm a gnome. Slicky Gastronome to be precise! So you're back to help out again eh? Well, I can't say as I blame you. Don't you just love the smell of all of that food? <drool>Enough loitering! Get out there and bring me back more rainbow fin albacore!"
8526,"Oh, how's it going, <class>? I see that you're interested in maybe gathering up food for the coming war at Ahn'Qiraj? Somehow my dad thought that it would be a good learning experience for me if I were to volunteer to help out here. Big mistake. I don't even like to eat meat.Anyway, if you feel like it, you could bring me back a lot of roast raptor. Apparently that's what all of the soldiers are going to want."
8527,Hi again <class>. I can tell you're very excited about all of this. So I suppose you want to bring me another twenty roast raptor. Great. Well you do that. I guess I'll see you when you get back.
8528,"It may not seem heroic to gather up cooked fish, but do not underestimate the value of preparation, young <class>. Soldiers need to eat like anyone else, and we're here to do our part to make sure they have what they need once the war in Ahn'Qiraj commences.Accordingly, I am stockpiling spotted yellowtail, a versatile source of sustenance that stores well and can be used in many different dishes. It also doesn't have the odor of some other saltwater fish. Are you willing to aid me in this endeavor?"
8529,"If you're still willing I'd like to send you back out to bring in another haul of spotted yellowtail, <name>. I'd imagine with the expertise you gained the first time out that this catch should be much faster and easier. Are you game?"
8532,"So glad that you've decided to help out here. Not everyone would, so I need to make sure you understand what it is that I need. Copper bars, not copper ore. We don't have the time or people to do all of the smelting ourselves, so if you would be so kind as to take care of that, your efforts will be duly noted. Is that something that you can handle, <class>?"
8533,"Back so soon? You'll be a real miner in no time <class>. So, you already know the drill; I need you to go out, mine up a mess of copper ore, smelt it into bars and bring it back to me here. I know that's something you're capable of, the question is, are you willing?"
8534,"We've sent our best scouts deep into the silithid hives to gather intelligence.  Scout Azenel has been watching the silithid movements at Hive'Zora for several days now.  Find her and obtain a written report.  We need to be able to act on that information as soon as possible, <name>."
8535,"The Twilight's Hammer and the elemental nobles they worship present a formidable threat to our operations in Silithus.  With the new enemies we're facing inside Ahn'Qiraj, we cannot afford to lower our guard to our enemies outside.Find a way to summon and destroy a Hoary Templar and report to Bor Wildmane."

8538,The links between the Twilight's Hammer and the Abyssal Council are proving to be more important than we had expected.We believe the elemental nobles known as the Abyssal Dukes are one of the primary force organizing the Twilight's Hammer cultists.  Find a way to lure the four Abyssal Dukes into our plane of existence and destroy them!Your dedication and prowess in past assignments have led us to choose you for this particular assignment.  We are certain you will succeed in this endeavor.
8539,Reinforcements have been called on to join the assault on Hive'Zora.  You have been selected to target Hive'Zora hive sisters.  Report back to Commander Mar'alith after completing your task.
8540,The mounted division of the Cenarion Hold guard is in short supply of ornate mithril boots.  Procure a batch and deliver them immediately to Captain Vish Kozus in Cenarion Hold.
8541,The Cenarion Hold guard is in short supply of grinding stones.  Procure a batch and deliver them immediately to Captain Vish Kozus in Cenarion Hold.
8542,"Lok'tar, <race>, I'm sure you already know that we're going to war at Ahn'Qiraj with the insects. But first the Warchief has decided that we're going to do something called 'prepare'. Though I'd rather be sharpening weapons and hammering armor into shape, I'm proud to have been chosen to be in charge of tin bar collection here. But I cannot do that without your help.So I need you to go out and make tin bars and bring them back to me here. I think I'm going to need more than I can count."
8543,"Very good, I see that you are serious about the war. I'm a little edgy waiting for it to start though, which means I'm going to get angry if you don't start bringing in the goods faster. Maybe I can just practice on you instead.Har! Maybe not, 'cuz then who would bring me back the tin bars?"
8544,It is said among us that the ornate shoulder armor worn by the mortal races started as an attempt to emulate the wings of a dragon.Bring me the bindings worn by the highest Qiraji leaders and I shall shape them into a set of pauldrons more dreadful than even the wings of Nefarian himself!
8545,"<class>, the war it is comin' and the only thing we can do is prepare for it. That be where you and I can help each other, mon. Ya see, they put me in charge of collectin' all the mithril bars we be needin' ta build for all the things we gonna need. An I still be needin' more!So, I be hopin' that you can get out there an mine us up some mithril, then smelt it into bars. Sound like something you can do for us?"
8546,"Yup, I be glad you're here, mon. You helped me before, and now I need your help again. We still lookin' ta bring in more mithril bars for the war effort; gonna build lots of armor and weapons and things to go squish them bugs at Ahn'Qiraj.So if you be a true friend, you bring me back more stacks of mithril bars. I take all you got until we hit our quota. You have some for me now?"
8548,"The badges you collect from performing combat, logistics and tactical assignments for Cenarion Hold are more than just for show, <name>.You'd be wise to hold on to them.  As you prove your loyalty to our organization I can offer you some of the gear we reserve for our closest allies in exchange for those badges."
8549,"It is said that every generation must face a defining trial. I fear the Ahn'Qiraj War will be the crucible in which our mettle is tested. So we prepare, and in so doing find what we are made of.I have volunteered to help the Horde by gathering as much peacebloom as possible, so that it can be made into potions for the war. I hope that you are here to lend me your aid. If so, then I need you to bring back to me a good quantity of the herb. Will you assist me, <class>?"
8550,"Hello again, Abyssmal. I am glad that you wish to speak to me once more concerning our neverending need for peacebloom. The war effort continues, and with it our production of potions and elixirs to aid in the battles to come. Will you help us again, <class>? I am in need of the same amount of peacebloom as before, so if you can gather it up and return it to me here I would be most grateful. Of course, if you already have it on your person, I will be more than happy to accept it from you now"
8551,"I used to sail a ship from here all the way to Ratchet, in Kalimdor.  I was a successful captain with a sterling reputation.Until...Those cursed sea giants ruined me!  They smashed my ship, killed my crew, and set me on a lifeboat to Booty Bay.  And one of the giants, Gorlash, stole my Captain's Chest.  He said he wanted it for a snuffbox.  The nerve!I hear Gorlash wanders the coast east of here.  Find him and get back my chest!  Do that, and you'll have earned a captain's gratitude."
8552,"This fine sash has the letters ""HS"" embroidered along its hem."
8553,"After I lost my first ship to those giants, I bought another.  Named Smotts' Revenge, I filled it with supplies and crew, and set out to find the villains.  I found them, but...they beat me.  They smashed Smotts' Revenge, killed my second crew and set me on another lifeboat.This time another of the giants, Negolash, stole my cutlass.Face Negolash and bring me my cutlass!Speak with Sprogger.  He was my cook on the Smotts' Revenge, and survived the last attack.  He can help you find the giant."
8554,"Negolash is a hungry giant.When the giants destroyed our ship, Negolash went straight for my kitchen.  He wasn't hungry for crew like the other giants.  Negolash wanted wine...and my Barbecued Buzzard Wings.  They're my specialty, and I had to go all the way to the Badlands for the recipe!If you want to lure the giant, then get some wine and a heap of buzzard wings.  Put them in our old lifeboat, southeast of here along the coast.  When Negolash smells all that food, he'll come for sure!"
8556,"The rings worn by the Qiraji lieutenants are rumored to grant them formidable abilities.  The corrupted gems that adorn them could, in theory, be swapped out with more pure materials to create uncorrupted versions of the rings.The gems that adorn Qiraji idols would work quite well, as their quality is superior.Bring me the ring and idols and I'll create a powerful ring for you, <class>."
8557,"I'm glad to hear you're aiding us in our attack on Ahn'Qiraj, <name>.  I can make you a protective item that'll be of assistance in the fight against our enemy, <class>.I shall need a Qiraji drape, which I'll resize for you of course.  I'll also need idols and scarabs which I'll use to create a suitable clasp.I promise you won't be disappointed."
8558,"The Qiraji and their servants wield items made with the rarest and finest materials: bones from gargantuan ancient creatures, gems from the depths of the earth, metals pure and strong.Just the sight of Qiraji artifacts fills me with an urge to practice my craft with their shattered and smelted pieces.  Prove your allegiance to the Circle, <name>, and I will make you a powerful weapon from the finest Qiraji materials."
8559,"Qiraji magic is strong and ancient.  The most powerful qiraji wield items of such might, they'd give pause even to a dragon.Bring me the qiraji bindings of command and other minor components by and I'll create a set of powerful boots for you.You will find them useful in the fight against the enemy."
8560,"You seek to prove your worth to my kind, mortal?  Very well, perhaps we can be of mutual assistance.The ancient sandworm, Ouro, is a being of legendary power.  He is rumored to have been created by the Old God himself as a mockery of life.His skin is unnatural... thick, nearly impregnable, yet it's flexible and allows him to move with the speed and grace of a much smaller creature.Bring me a sample of his skin along with other minor components and I shall craft you leggings of great power."
8561,"The Twin Emperors... their incessant whispers are slowly taking a toll on my sanity.  They mock me, knowing I cannot step further into their domain to save my brother Arygos.In my visions I see their monstrous faces adorned by powerful crowns.  But I will have my revenge... I will transmute these symbols of Qiraji power to ones better suited to our needs.Bring me the components I require, <name>.  I will give you a headpiece of unmatched power."
8562,"The unmentionable Old God slowly awakens from his slumber beneath Ahn'Qiraj.  The terrible fate that awaits Azeroth could come in days or years; time has no meaning for beings of his power.When the stars are favorable, he will lash out against all living beings with terrible wrath.  You must find him before then and find a way to bring his existence to an end.Do this and bring me a piece of his husk.  I shall grant you armor no mortal has ever worn... armor fit for one who has slain a god!"
8572,"The badges you collect from performing combat, logistics and tactical assignments for Cenarion Hold are more than just for show, <name>.You'd be wise to hold on to them.

8575,You cannot understand a single word on this ledger. You don't even know what language it is written in!
8577,"If I am to translate anything, I will need my scrying goggles. Unfortunately, those were stolen quite some time ago by my ex-best friend forever, Stewvul. He broke my heart in five places and then left me here to rot."
8578,<You hear a sigh of relief escape the crate.>
8580,"Hey, <class>. Ya you, mon! There be a whole mess of firebloom the Horde thinkin' they need for this Ahn'Qiraj war effort. Maybe they put it in nice things that go boom? Maybe they give it to the Alliance as fuel for their steam tanks? Who knows? Not Pele'keiki!Pele'keiki know this though... he know you gonna help him out and bring back lots of the firebloom, right, mon?"
8581,"Pele'keiki know you come to help. Bring many firebloom and make him very happy. Pele'keiki might make big bombs with firebloom. Drop them on insects from his bat over Ahn'Qiraj when war come. But Pele'keiki need more firebloom, <class>!You gonna bring Pele'keiki that firebloom, real quick now. Come back with at least as much as last time, and Pele'keiki be pleased."
8582,"The purple lotus, <class>, is a reagent in a great many potions, elixirs and oils, some of which will be of use to us at Ahn'Qiraj. We're going to need to create an immense number of those potions for the war effort. And I'm going to experiment to find more uses for the lotus as well. But to do all of that I'm going to need a great quantity of the flower.That's where you come in. Go out into the field and collect up as many purple lotuses as you can. Is this something that you are willing to do for us?"
8583,"In fact it does appear that we are in need of even more purple lotus, <class>. While my own studies have yet to determine a new useful application for the herb, there are tried and true methodologies yet to be employed.I need you to once again go out into the field and collect at least twenty purple lotus samples. Return them to me here."
8584,"If there is one thing that you should know about me, it is this: NEVER ask me about my business! I work with things you simply cannot understand. Like for example: Do you know what a psychotronic muzzledorf is? Of course you don't! And that's why we leave the planning to me and the fetching to you."
8585,"Legend has it that the chimaerok of the Isle of Dread in Feralas have the most succulent and tender vittles in existence! Now these chimaerok also have a daddy who, with proper preparation, may or may not look like a 500 pound chicken."
8586,My recipe is complete! What I need from you now is some rocket fuel and deeprock salt. I'll handle the spices and the meat you brought me will cover the rest.
8587,"I'm a goblin of my word, kid. Here's your 500 pound chicken."
8588,"Since we're preparing for war, it might be best if we get all of the goods we need first, don't you think, mon? One of the staples of the war materiel that we're producing is heavy leather. We'll use it for just about everything, from reinforcement to armor, and good old plain tarps too.But first we need to get our hands on more of it. That's your job, <class>. Sharpen your knife and bring me back a bundle. Then we'll talk further."
8589,"It's true, <class>, I still need more heavy leather. The requests from the generals and their quartermasters seem endless. And that's nothing compared to what the zeppelin masters are asking for!I need to get my quota collected on the double. Baekun, bring me more stacks of heavy leather as soon as you can!"
8590,"I'm glad that you decided to speak to me about this, <class>. It looks like the Horde's preparations for the upcoming Ahn'Qiraj War are in full swing. But you and I still need to do our part.I've been asked to collect a great number of thick leather skins for use in all manner of war materiel, and I need you to help me by going out there and gathering them up. There's honor and the gratitude of the Horde in it for you should you decide to help. Will you?"
8591,"Druid, as you can see I still need to gather up more thick leather. Once again I ask your help with this task, and promise that if you complete it, you will be recognized for your efforts.Time is of the essence! Return to me with the thick leather so that we can finish our preparations and go to war, hero!"

8595,"I see that you're no ordinary mortal, <name>. Your chances against the Old God, however infinitely small, are greater than ours at this point. After all, while he expects dragons at his doorstep, he is not prepared for someone like you.Just as Anachronos and Staghelm defeated the Qiraji a thousand years ago through the alliance of mortal and dragon races, we too shall form a pact. Gain the trust of the Bronze Dragonflight and you'll gain our trust. Only then we shall make a true champion out of you."
8596,"Qiraji magic is strong and ancient.

8599,"It isn't often that I get visitors. As a matter of fact, the last time I had a visitor was when I rescued that dear, sweet gnome from the wreckage of the crashed flying machine."
8600,"I find that the fit of the knife in your palm is more important than the edge on it. Even the dullest blade can be made to cut if pressure is being properly applied through it, wouldn't you agree, <class>? But you and I don't have such problems as we maintain the sharpest of edges, yes?Well, no matter, I have a task for you. In service to the Horde, and to do your part for the Ahn'Qiraj war effort, I want you to return to me with a number of rugged leather skins. This is something that you will do, no?"
8601,"Preparations for the impending war at Ahn'Qiraj are proceeding, <class>. However, to ensure that we do not fall behind, or at least that I am not the one that causes us to fall behind, I want for you to bring back another stack of rugged leather. Your prompt attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated, <name>."
8602,It is said among us that the ornate shoulder armor worn by the mortal races started as an attempt to emulate the wings of a dragon.Bring me the bindings worn by the highest Qiraji leaders and I shall shape them into a set of pauldrons more dreadful than even the wings of Nefarian himself!
8603,"The unmentionable Old God slowly awakens from his slumber beneath Ahn'Qiraj.  The terrible fate that awaits Azeroth could come in days or years; time has no meaning for beings of his power.When the stars are favorable, he will lash out against all living beings with terrible wrath.  You must find him before then and find a way to bring his existence to an end.Do this and bring me a piece of his husk.  I shall grant you armor no mortal has ever worn... armor fit for one who has slain a god!"
8604,"Greetings, <class>. In preparation for the war at Ahn'Qiraj, I am here coordinating the Horde's efforts at gathering wool bandages. Unfortunately, out in the field, our soldiers cannot afford to rely upon the presence of a healer to keep them alive. Trust me, I know first hand. Thus, we're putting together all of these first aid kits for them.If you have the time, I need many wool bandages. Return them to me here and I will see to it that you are properly rewarded."
8605,"Good to see you again, <class>. We are still working on preparations here for the war effort, and I can still use all of the help that you can give in gathering up wool bandaging. Any assistance at all will be greatly appreciated. I only hope that our efforts will be good enough. I've lost too many noble souls on the battlefields of yesterday to not do everything in my power to see to it that doesn't happen again."
8606,I've got it! Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to fill a sack up with rocks and you're going to make the drop. I know it said that I should make the delivery and I'm going to - sort of.
8607,"I trust that you are speaking to me because you are going to help with the collection I have been entrusted to? Good! By whatever means, and I do mean whatever, I wish for you to gather up a good number of mageweave bandages. Fresh would be nice, but not absolutely necessary. Return them to me here, <class>, and I will personally see to it that you are properly rewarded."
8608,"You returned? Interesting. As you can see I am still collecting for the Ahn'Qiraj 'war effort'. Which means that I need you to once again go out and collect a stack of mageweave bandages for me. I look forward to your return, <class>."
8609,"It appears inevitable that the Horde and Alliance are on a collision course for war at Ahn'Qiraj. Surprisingly, it is not a war with each other, but rather with the silithid, and whatever force controls them. Also surprisingly, both sides are doing their part to gather the resources necessary to wage a successful war.I am collecting runecloth bandages to distribute to the soldiers, but I won't be successful without assistance, hopefully yours. Is this something that you can aid me with, <class>?"
8610,"Ever does the time grow nearer when we shall launch ourselves headlong into the conflagration at Ahn'Qiraj, priest. But first we must gather our strength and prepare so that we can survive the onslaught of the insects and their masters.If you are here again, then surely you wish to make another contribution of runecloth bandages to the war effort? Please do so as soon as you can and return to me once more."
8611,"I'm not standing here just to get a nice tan, <class>. There are war preparations to be made. If we're going to crush those bugs at Ahn'Qiraj then we need to be ready, and that includes food too!They have me gathering and salting lean wolf steaks here for the upcoming war. But since I need to stay here to take care of all of this, I need you to go out, kill some wolves and then cook up the meat into lean wolf steaks and bring them back to me here. You got all that?"
8612,"As you can see, <class>, we still need to pack away more food for the soldiers. I don't know if you've ever been in a war before, but once you get past the initial shock of the battlefield, you can get pretty hungry. You did a good job last time, so I expect that you'll do as well, if not a little quicker, in getting me another stack of those lean wolf steaks."
8613,"It be a nice day for fishin', don't'cha think mon? Good thing, cuz I be needin' a lot of fish it lookin' like. The Horde, they askin' me to be in charge of collectin' a ton of the spotted yellowtail for them. They say they needin' it for the war they getting' ready for at Ahn'Qiraj. I say to them I do the best I can. So I be needin' to get some help. You gonna be helpin' me, <class>?"
8614,"So as you can see, we still be needin' a lot of the fishies. The combatants in the upcomin' Ahn'Qiraj War gonna be needin' a lot to eat, so I needin' to get all the spotted yellowtail that I can. You catch 'em, cook 'em, and bringin' 'em back to me here, and I be givin' you thanks, and the thanks of the Horde."
8615,"The Ahn'Qiraj war effort is an immense undertaking, <class>. All of the materials being gathered here, whether it is metal for weapons, or food to eat, are all as important as the other. For, if you haven't eaten in days you will not have the strength to lift your axe when it matters.Thus, we gather what food we can. I am collecting baked salmon, a dish that was chosen both for its sustenance and its ability to keep well. Can you aid me with this task, <class>?"
8616,"The last batch of baked salmon that you donated to the war effort looked very delicious, <class>. I must admit that I was tempted to take a few for myself. As you can tell, we have not yet reached our quota here. I am hoping you have returned because you have another stack of baked salmon with you"
8620,"I should have known. My arch-enemy, Doctor Weavil, up to his old tricks! And now, thanks to your failure in Winterspring, Doctor Weavil has destroyed my book! How are you going to save the world now, hero?"

8918,"Hail, <class>!  I can tell by your demeanor that you've seen and done much in this world.  Yet I'm willing to wager you haven't seen a piece of armor like this.Perform a small favor for me and I'll be willing to trade it to you for an ordinary set of bracers.I'm in need of a sizeable sample of venom drawn from the spiders and scorpions that inhabit Silithus.

Bring this to me along with a few gold coins and I'll perform the exchange."
8921,"Ah, you're in need of my latest project... the extra-dimensional ghost revealer!  Unfortunately I've run out of funds and manpower.You're willing to help?  Excellent!  Our first task is to build a device to harvest the very fabric of death!  Building an ectoplasmic distiller won't be an easy task, <name>.I'll need you to bring me an arcanite converter, some greater eternal essences and stonescale oil. I'll also need some volcanic ash from the lava pools in the Burning Steppes to build a filter."
8922,"I must find a way to speak with Anthion Harmon... or more specifically, his ghost!I know of an engineer with a queer interest in the supernatural.  He claims he can build a machine that allows him to speak with the dead!The blood you collected was intended for him; travel to Gadgetzan and bring it to him as payment for his services!"
8923,"You must be quite brave to have stuck around after that.  That or I've piqued your interest with the piece of armor I gave you.  There is more from where that came from, if you're still interested in aiding me.The venom samples you collected are for an acquaintance of mine, Mux Manascrambler, an engineer with an interest in the supernatural.  His latest project consists of a device that allows you to communicate with the dead!  My last hope is to contact Anthion and find out more about my situation."
8924,"A fine piece of engineering, if I do say so myself!  You will need to travel a bit, I'm afraid, in order to find the incorporeal undead we require.You see, different climates lend different consistencies to the spectral fabric of the dead.  The tortured night elves of Silithus, the spirits of the highborne from Winterspring and the ghosts and banshees of the Eastern Plaguelands should give us the different types of ectoplasm we need.  Be sure to place the distiller nearby before you harvest them!"
8925,"Next we shall need to find a stable and portable source of energy to keep the ectoplasm active.  I've heard rumors of a mighty elemental called Magma Lord Bokk, whose heart is a powerful magma core - an endless supply of heat!It's said he can be found in the Burning Steppes, south of Blackrock Mountain.  Bring the magma core to me and we shall have enough juice to power the extra-dimensional ghost revealer!"
8926,You kept your word and brought the device built by Mux.  I believe a reward is in order if I'm to keep you interested in saving my skin.  Bring me the belt and set of gloves that you wish to upgrade.  I promise the ones I give you in return will be far superior.
8927,"You've proven to be a very reliable individual, <name>.  As much as I trust that you'll help me through this predicament, it would be wise of me to reward you according to your performance.For now I will exchange your belt and gloves.  If we both see this through I shall make the rest of the pieces available to you."
8928,The core will provide us with enough juice to power our device; now we just have to build a rod that can channel that energy without melting.I met an imp in Winterspring that sold all manner of exotic goods.  He had an elemental rod that would do perfectly.  I'm kicking myself in the head right now for not having bought it.He lives inside a cave in the entrance to Darkwhisper Gorge.  Sneak in there and try to find him.Make sure he only charges you forty gold; that's the price he quoted me!
8929,"Well, nothing left for us to do but try out the goblin's invention.  Word has it that Anthion was mowed down by the undead legions of Stratholme as he tried to enter its gates.Try using the device there and find out whatever Anthion knew."
8930,"Very well, <name>.  All that remains is to put the goblin's invention to the test.  Word has it that Anthion was slain by the undead legions of Stratholme as he tried to enter its gates.Try using the device there and see if, indeed, you can speak with the dead!"
8931,You kept your word and brought the device built by Mux.  I believe a reward is in order if I'm to keep you interested in saving my skin.  Bring me an ordinary belt and a set of gloves that you wish to upgrade.

8945,"I'll provide you the information you ask for, <name>.  But more pressing matters are at hand.My beloved wife has been taken prisoner by Rivendare's undead scum.I strongly objected to her joining the Argent Dawn's foolish crusade, yet that's not of importance anymore.  You must finish what I attempted to do, you must rescue Ysida from the clutches of the Baron!"
8946,"It is the cruelest of fates that my beloved has perished while trying to rescue me.  Yet, you claim to possess the ability to converse with him.Bring him this locket as proof that I am well.  He must not linger in this world; my heart would not be able to bear it.Farewell, <name>.  I shall be in your debt always."
8947,"We didn't realize the importance of Valthalak's medallion, so it was divided along with the rest of the spoils.  The first piece was taken by a dwarf named Theldren.  I tried to retrieve it from him and he beat me within an inch of my life.  You shall have to take the fragment by force.Last I heard of him, he'd become a gladiator for the Dark Iron dwarves.  Getting him to fight you is going to present a bit of a challenge, though.Gather the following materials for me.  You're going to need them."
8948,"Theldren is not one to willingly participate in a fair fight.  I've shaped this banner to display his family colors.With some additional sorcery, this banner shall provoke him in a way he won't be able to resist.An old acquaintance of mine named Falrin knows the exact procedure required.  He has a particular way of... aggravating people.  You shall find him at the library in Dire Maul."
8949,"Yes, it is true that I am familiar with this enchantment you require, <class>.  Yet I'm not one to give out favors freely, even if you were sent here by an old friend.I hold nothing but hatred and contempt for our brutish ogre neighbors.  And not only them, I hate the followers of Omokk just as much as I hate those that follow King Gordok.I want you to kill them.  Kill lots of them!  Bring me the beads they carry around their neck as proof of your work.  Do this and we shall talk about your request."
8950,"I can place the enchantment you require on the banner quite easily, <name>.  Unfortunately I don't have the materials I need as it is very rarely that someone asks for this sort of charm.I will require the essence of one of the Eldreth ghosts that haunt these halls, a handful of Scholomance dark runes and some large brilliant shards.  Bring me these reagents and I shall perform this task for you."
8951,"Valthalak's soul was stored in this amulet.  In our greed we foolishly split it into three parts, not knowing the curse that would await us.The only way to stop Valthalak's spell is to put the medallion back together.  Return to Deliana and tell her that Bodley is her only hope for finding the remaining pieces.  Speak to her about any rewards you've arranged for.I, for once, shall rest in peace.  I wish you the best of luck; you shall need every bit of it!"

8960,"So we need to recover the rest of the medallion?  Finding Bodley's going to be a bit of a headache.  He went back to Blackrock Mountain to attempt to re-enter Blackrock Spire and never came back.I'd suggest taking the goblin's ghost revealing device with you, as I fear the worst might have happened."
8961,"In order to summon Lord Valthalak we're first going to need to gather the other two-thirds of the amulet. To do that we need to get a brazier and some special coals to burn in it.There are three nobles of fire, Lord Incedius in Blackrock Depths, Pyroguard Emberseer in Blackrock Spire and The Duke of Cynders in Silithus, with what we need. Collect from each a piece of their remains, and then return to me with a Hallowed Brazier, which can be purchased from the Argent Dawn if you are honored by them."
8962,"<class>, listen closely. Now that we have the brazier, and the means to light it, we still need another component to suffuse it with; something that will provide a focus strong enough to entice the spirit of my deceased, former comrade.Mor Grayhoof, our most prominent druid, had many close friends amongst the Cenarion Circle, some of which have fallen to the silithid. I need you to retrieve some Druidical Remains from the silithid that inhabit the environs of Hive'Regal in southeastern Silithus."
8963,"<class>, listen closely. Now that we have the brazier, and the means to light it, we still need another component to suffuse it with; something that will provide a focus strong enough to entice the spirit of my deceased, former comrade.Isalien, our priestess, grew up in Winterspring at Starbreeze Village. I need you to gather a Starbreeze Village Relic from the Frostmaul giants of Frostwhisper Gorge in southern Winterspring, who are known for raiding to the north from time to time."
8964,"<class>, listen closely. Now that we have the brazier, and the means to light it, we still need another component to suffuse it with; something that will provide a focus strong enough to summon the remains of my deceased, former comrades.The siblings, Jarien and Sothos, were believers in the way of the Scarlet Crusade. They aspired to knighthood within that vile organization. Go to Tyr's Hand in Eastern Plaguelands and retrieve a Brilliant Sword of Zealotry from the praetorians there."
8965,"<class>, listen closely. Now that we have the brazier, and the means to light it, we still need another component to suffuse it with; something that will provide a focus strong enough to entice the spirit of my deceased, former comrade.An ogre necromancer that traveled with us, Kormok, delighted in summoning forth the souls of the banished dead of Purgation Isle, off the south coast of the Hillsbrad Foothills. Go there and retrieve some Soul Ashes of the Banished from their remains."
8966,"My friend, Mor Grayhoof, was the first to fall victim to possession of a piece of Lord Valthalak's amulet, and the corrupting spirit fragment that it contains. After stealing Valthalak's spellbook and amulet, we fled for our lives from the upper portion of Blackrock Spire. Along the way, Mor fell into the lower portion of the spire.Later, we discovered that he survived the fall, only to be captured and tortured by War Master Voone. A few spectral assassins snuck in and slew him right in front of Voone."
8967,"It became known to us in later days, as we were doing what we could ourselves to survive, that Isalien, a night elf priestess of our company, had gone to the night elvic ancestral city, now known as Dire Maul. From what we gathered, she went there both for personal reasons and also to unlock the secrets of the piece of the amulet that she had in her possession.She didn't quite make it, though. Word got back to us that she was ambushed at the Shrine of Eldretharr by Alzzin the Wildshaper and his forces."
8968,"The siblings, Jarien and Sothos, decided to join the Scarlet Crusade upon the disbanding of our mercenary company. They took the left piece of Lord Valthalak's amulet with them. Good riddance, I say, but we need that piece back.From what we could gather, they were actually slain by Grand Crusader Dathrohan himself for failing the initiation rites inside his chamber in the Scarlet Bastion.In any case, we... meaning you, are still going to need to retrieve that piece of the amulet."
8969,"Now we have what we need, so it's time to discuss who it is that you'll be summoning.Kormok was ok for an ogre, right up until he turned to necromancy. After that, things got creepy for just about everyone in the outfit. It was no surprise then when he took his piece of the amulet and returned to his new home, Scholomance.But even there, or perhaps especially there, he was not safe from the spectral assassins. They slew him right in front of his master, Ras Frostwhisper."
8970,"As I was saying, <class>, in my living years I flirted with becoming a diviner. But, there really wasn't as much profit in it as you might imagine, mostly because it's dangerous and the reagents are rare and expensive. However, I do know enough to be able to pinpoint the final piece of the amulet, and the spirit of my former comrade along with it.This is where you come in, <name>. I need you to go to Alcaz Island off the coast of Dustwallow Marsh and collect Bloodkelp from the Strashaz naga that live there."
8977,"It's been great working with you, <name>.  Here is the finished product.I hope it helps you in your current endeavors.  And hey, if you don't mind, help spread the word.  I wouldn't mind having more customers!"
8978,"It's been great working with you, <name>.  Here is the finished product.I hope it helps you in your current endeavors.  And hey, if you don't mind, help spread the word.  I wouldn't mind having more customers!"
8979,"I believe I know the cause of this recent behavior. Have you smelled the new fragrance on the wind, over the stink of the canals? The new colognes and perfumes that have come into fashion?Our thinking has been clouded by some foul alchemy.There is only one way to be sure - bring a bottle of cologne and perfume to my friend, Apothecary Zinge. The Royal Apothecary Society will find the truth.I will reimburse you for their purchase when you return."
8980,"This is unexpected. It looks like Fenstad might be on to something after all. I found traces of substances used in mind control potions.It isn't unheard of for perfumes to have some of this, but a few of the ingredients I detected... This is serious alchemy, along the abilities of a member of the Royal Apothecary Society."
8982,"We must find who the supplier is. I noticed Apothecary Katrina with a bottle of the perfume tucked in her pack. She told me that she purchased it from Norman, the innkeeper."
8983,"Something's wrong with my product? Well, I've never seen so many people wanting something so badly.I bought my supply from a merchant named Mara Rennick. She's new in town.She mentioned she had some goods she had to deliver to the tailor in the Mage Quarter."
8984,"Look, the actions of a rogue apothecary are not my concern. If he's undermining our efforts, then let me be the first to point you in the right directionIf he's innocent, then he's got nothing to hide, right?I purchased the goods from Apothecary Staffron Lerent. He's working in a secluded area past Ravenholdt Manor in the hills over Hillsbrad. To be honest with you, I thought he was a little odd."
8985,"<class>, listen closely. Now that we have the location of the last amulet piece, we still need another component to suffuse the brazier with; something that will provide a focus strong enough to entice the spirit of my deceased, former comrade.Isalien, our priestess, grew up in Winterspring at Starbreeze Village.

They slew him right in front of his master, Ras Frostwhisper."
8994,"We're nearly there, <class>. All that is left is to retrieve a few more components so that I can attune the brazier and enable it to beckon forth Lord Valthalak.To begin I must ask you to journey forth into Blackrock Spire and slay the orcs therein. They wear bracers that contain trace metals that I will need, so I'll need more than a few to extract the right amount out of them. Then, to complete the imbuing process, you'll need to bring me a Flask of Supreme Power.Good luck, <name>!"
8995,"All is now ready, <name>.When alive, Lord Valthalak used to inhabit what is now The Beast's chamber. Go there and use the Brazier of Beckoning to summon forth Lord Valthalak. It will reincorporate him, so he'll have to be killed again. I'd take care of The Beast first, and be sure take enough friends along to survive the upper portion of Blackrock Spire.Once you've dispatched Valthalak, use the amulet on his corpse. With his spirit reunified, he'll likely want his amulet back, as well.Good luck!"
8996,"I will ignore your impertinence this time, <class>, because you have done a noble thing today; returning the rest of my stolen spirit to me. Despite your obviously weak nature, <race>, you have shown courage where those that stole from me did not, and probably never could!Return to them, before I change my mind and slay you where you stand. Go back and tell them that they are safe... for now."
8997,"I suppose that this is goodbye then, my friend. But, I'll always be here if you want to come back and talk with me from time to time. Probably while you're loitering around waiting for your buddies to join you for a raid on Blackrock Spire.Go, before I start to cry. Go back to Deliana in Ironforge and tell her what's happened."

You look fit to travel -- perhaps a journey is in order.Midsummer cannot be truly appreciated unless you've seen the blistering blue fires abroad.

Return once your journey is complete."

Burn him to ashes and take the prismatic shell he covets so dearly."
9364,"My research has revealed a unique purpose for the prismatic shell.Carry the shell and cast your polymorph spell on the Spitelash in Azshara.

I've not yet heard if the fires in all capitals are properly burning. Travel there yourself and warm yourself by the fires--make sure they're hot!"

Bodies wear down quick in the desert.The dwarves have been getting reinforcements daily, and we can't afford to lose ground in our struggle for resources in Silithus.Get your instructions from the General. It's not my job to train you, just find you."
9419,"We recently found out that the Horde has been scavenging the Silithus desert for resources, but paid them little mind. We thought it could not be worth it to station large numbers in this sweltering desert.However, it was discovered the importance of the resources, and now we are scrambling to catch up.If I have your assistance, you must go into the desert and recover the silithyst and return it here."
9422,"For some time now, we have been tapping the crystal resources of the Silithus desert. The only dangers we faced were from the creatures that made this place their home and the oppressive sand and dust and heat.But now the Alliance seems to have caught on to what we have found here. It is now a race between us to capture the natural resources, and keep them from the other.I need every set of hands that is available. I hope I have yours."
9664,"Welcome to the Plaguelands, <name>. As you know, the Forsaken and their allies hold the lands to the west of here against our best efforts. The Alliance commanders have decided that here in the east, we will establish new fortifications to tighten the noose around our enemies.Towers long abandoned since the days of Lordaeron are to be seized and rebuilt for this purpose. These lands are dangerous, and we could use your help."
9665,"Agents of the Forsaken uncovered an Alliance plot to establish new bases here in the Eastern Plaguelands, at abandoned towers throughout the area.It is imperative that we not allow them to establish a significant presence on our eastern borders, and so we must stave off this Alliance incursion. Our current plans are to drive them out of any towers they may have already seized, and occupy those that we have under our control against further attacks."
